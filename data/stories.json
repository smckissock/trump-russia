      "[Inside Trump’s financial ties to Russia and his unusual flattery of Vladimir Putin]\n\nTrump was eager for Putin to attend the event, but the Russian president canceled a planned appearance at the last minute, Aras Agalarov told The Washington Post in a 2016 interview.",
      "In a June 18, 2013, tweet, Trump wrote: “Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow — if so, will he become my new best friend?”\n\nHis letter to Putin was written that month, according to the people familiar with the document.",
      "Investigators for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III have asked witnesses questions about the Miss Universe pageant and Trump’s interest in having Putin attend the event, according to people familiar with the inquiry.",
      "The following month, at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, Trump defended himself from criticism from Clinton that he wanted to befriend Putin: “I’m saying to myself, what’s wrong with that?",
      "Trump’s letter to Putin, which was described by people with knowledge of its contents, shows how interested he was in attracting the personal attention of the Russian president.",
      "Trump was approached by billionaire Moscow developer Aras Agalarov and his pop star son, Emin, who said they would pay to bring Miss Universe to the Russian capital.",
      "The letter, the first known attempt at direct outreach by Trump to Putin, has been turned over to investigators probing Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign.",
      "At the time, Trump made no secret that he hoped Putin would attend the Miss Universe pageant, which was being held in Russia for the first time.",
      "A U.S.-based employee for the Agalarovs also attended, as did Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.",
      "“I do have a relationship, and I can tell you that he’s very interested in what we’re doing here today,” Trump told MSNBC while in Moscow.",
      "The real estate magnate, who owned the Miss Universe pageant, wrote the note at a time when he was looking to expand his brand to Russia.",
      "At the bottom of the typed letter, Trump scrawled a postscript adding that he looked forward to seeing “beautiful” women during his trip.",
      "President Trump chats with Russian President Vladimir Putin in November 2017 at a summit in the Vietnamese city of Danang.",
      "It is unclear whether Trump’s missive was ever delivered to the Russian president — and if so, whether Putin responded.",
      "“He was very happy.”\n\nDuring the pageant, Trump suggested that Putin was following the event and Trump’s role in it.",
      "Over the years, Donald Trump has offered inconsistent stories about whether he met Putin before he became president.",
      "Mueller’s team also has examined Trump’s relationship with the Agalarovs, which extended beyond the 2013 pageant.",
      "I never met Putin.”\n\nIn the same news conference, Trump called on Russia to find and release Clinton’s emails.",
      "“That was a very complicated situation then, because I promised Trump he would meet Putin,” Agalarov said.",
      "But in 2013, a new opportunity emerged through another business he owned: the Miss Universe pageant.",
      "Trump has repeatedly sought to build a tower in Russia since the late 1980s, without success.",
      "Instead, Putin sent a “friendly” letter and a gift of a Russian lacquered box, he said.",
      "“If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,” Trump Jr. responded.",
      "A White House spokesman and attorneys for the Trump Organization declined to comment.",
      "John Dowd, an attorney for President Trump, said he was not familiar with the letter.",
      "Trump Jr. has said that no information about Clinton was provided at the meeting.",
      "The pageant was part of a years-long effort to bring the Trump name to Russia.",

      "That’s good.”\n\nJosh Dawsey and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.",
      "Days later, he met with the lawyer at Trump Tower in New York.",

      "The spy chief had previously identified the Russian government as a source of cyberspying, telling the House Intelligence Committee, “Russian intelligence services continue to target U.S. and allied personnel with access to sensitive computer network information.”\n\nA spokesperson for Clapper’s office told The Daily Beast that the director’s warnings about Russia were “deliberate” and intended to ensure that a “broader audience of Americans,” and not just cybersecurity experts, know that China wasn’t the only significant threat.",
      "Alperovitch said there was “no indication that [the cyberintrusions] are retaliatory.” Rather, as Russia finds itself struggling to stay afloat, “they are using cyber espionage to at least in part compensate for loss of competitiveness they are experiencing.” Alperovitch said the hacking has been tied to a single source, or “actor,” that CrowdStrike refers to as Cozy Bear.",
      "Three former U.S. intelligence officers who worked on counterintelligence and cyber operations told The Daily Beast that a new report this week accusing Russia of infiltrating unclassified networks at the White House was apparently designed to send a message to the Kremlin: We know what you’re up to, and how you’re doing it.",
      "With regards to attributing hacks to Russia, one of the former U.S. intelligence officials said that analysts have catalogued the specific tools Russian hackers use and have developed signatures that, he said, give analysts across the intelligence community confidence that Russia is a major source of cyber espionage.",
      "Beginning in March 2014, the Obama administration imposed a series of sanctions designed to punish Russia for its invasion of Crimea and subsequent military incursions in eastern Ukraine, and U.S. officials have said they’re helping to depress Russia’s economy, already hurting because of falling oil prices.",
      "In the past year, researchers have also linked Russian hackers believed to be working for the government to other spying campaigns, including against NATO, the Ukrainian government, energy companies in Poland, and an academic at an American university who was targeted because he studies Ukraine.",
      "Ever since the U.S. government hit Russia with economic sanctions last year, Russian hackers have started new cyberspying campaigns to steal information from U.S. government agencies and corporations, according to current and former American intelligence officials and cybersecurity experts.",
      "A former senior U.S. intelligence official told The Daily Beast that Russian hackers are among the best at posing as U.S. government employees or other trusted parties and then tricking others into disclosing login credentials that allow the hackers to get access to more computer networks.",
      "“We are seeing them across energy, finance and defense sectors, as well government agencies and national-security nonprofits.”\n\nClapper has spoken approvingly of the current sanctions regime and credits it with helping to depress the Russian economy and inflate the value of the ruble.",
      "Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Senate committee in February that “the Russian cyberthreat is more severe than we have previously assessed.” And last year, he twice singled out Russian hackers as among the most significant cyberthreats to the United States.",
      "In an interview with the Russian state-owned RIA Novotsi, Aleksandr Gostev of the Russian security company Kaspersky Labs said it would be “extremely difficult” to pin the activity on Russia, and noted that circumstantial evidence could be used to fabricate a case.",
      "On Tuesday, CNN reported that according to U.S. officials, Russian hackers had penetrated portions of the White House computer network by gaining access from another “perch,” at the State Department, where intruders had gotten inside the unclassified email system.",
      "In recent months, U.S. intelligence officials have been sounding the alarm about Russian hackers, who they see as more sophisticated and harder to track than their cohort in China, the other major source of cyberspying on the U.S. government and companies.",
      "Chinese cyberspying has tended to grab headlines, particularly after the Justice Department last year indicted five Chinese military officers for an espionage campaign targeting U.S. industries, including aluminum processors and solar-panel manufacturers.",
      "Disclosing the new details posed little risk to ongoing operations, the former officials said, because the hack had already been disclosed and it concerned sensitive materials—such as President Obama’s travel schedule—but not any classified information.",
      "“We are seeing a dramatic rise in cyber intrusion activity from the Russian government since the sanctions regime was put in place against them last year,” Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, told The Daily Beast.",
      "“We are literally tracking hundreds of breaches that they’ve been initiating against both government and commercial targets and have been battling and stopping their intrusion attempts at a number of our customers,” Alperovitch said.",
      "Last week, Obama signed an executive order that allows the U.S. to impose sanctions on individuals and entities for hacking that poses a “significant” threat to U.S. national security, including economic and financial stability.",
      "At the time, current and former officials told The Daily Beast that their confidence was based in large part on intelligence operations against North Korea that showed hackers in the Hermit Kingdom were hitting U.S. targets.",
      "A report in 2013 by the security research firm Critical Intelligence concluded that “Chinese adversaries” have infiltrated the networks of U.S. energy companies to steal information about fracking and gas extraction.",
      "“We know a lot about the Chinese only because they’re a lot noisier about it,” Clapper said, echoing remarks by other U.S. officials and experts who say that Chinese hackers seem not to care if they’re detected.",
      "Russia is “going to town on us and exploiting our information, our intellectual property,” Clapper said after a speech at the University of Texas in Austin last October.",
      "One former intelligence official read the information in the new report as “a veiled threat” to Russia that there could be further consequences for malicious hacking.",
      "CrowdStrike’s Alperovitch said Russian hacking over the past year has been targeting a broad range of industries, but all ones that are important to Russia’s economy.",
      "The report said Chinese hackers had also targeted companies that make petrochemicals, such as plastics, for which natural gas is a precursor ingredient.",
      "Rather, it was acknowledged by the White House last year after intruders accessed an unclassified network used by the Executive Office of the President.",
      "But, Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February, those measures still haven’t changed President Vladimir Putin’s strategy in Ukraine.",
      "“I worry, frankly, more about the Russians, who are a lot more subtle and a lot more sophisticated about purloining our information,” Clapper said.",
      "Nor have current U.S. officials offered any technical evidence that could support their claims of Russian hacking and be independently examined.",
      "Similar doubts about attributing hacks to foreign governments emerged when U.S. officials blamed North Korea for an attack on Sony last year.",
      "Russian military forces continue to back separatist rebels who have threatened to take more territory in the eastern portion of the country.",
      "Ultimately, President Obama and FBI Director James Comey publicly asserted that they were confident that North Korea was to blame.",
      "Alperovitch said it wasn’t clear whether the Russian hackers are working directly for the government or are contractors.",
      "(U.S. intelligence officials have noted that Moscow uses both its own hacking teams and outsources some work, as well.)",
      "Now, American officials are fighting back—by outing the hackers and issuing what some see as veiled threats to Moscow.",
      "Clapper also said the bigger threat to Russia’s financial stability was the low price of oil on the global market.",
      "The intrusion reported by CNN is not “a new incident,” a spokesman for the National Security Council said.",
      "“We are not configured collectively as as government and as a nation to defend against this as we should.”",
      "“We are confident they are working on behalf of the Russian intelligence agencies,” he said.",
      "“The greater impact frankly on the economy has been the drop in oil prices,” Clapper said.",
      "That could be another motivator for Russia to ramp up spying on U.S. energy companies.",
      "“It is a serious, serious problem,” he said during his remarks in Austin.",
      "In that respect, they may be borrowing a page from the Chinese playbook.",
      "And not everyone agrees that Moscow is behind the recent assaults.",
      "Alperovitch didn’t provide any technical details about the case.",
      "Certainly Clapper shares that view."

      "The spy chief had previously identified the Russian government as a source of cyberspying, telling the House Intelligence Committee, “Russian intelligence services continue to target U.S. and allied personnel with access to sensitive computer network information.”\n\nA spokesperson for Clapper’s office told The Daily Beast that the director’s warnings about Russia were “deliberate” and intended to ensure that a “broader audience of Americans,” and not just cybersecurity experts, know that China wasn’t the only significant threat.",
      "Alperovitch said there was “no indication that [the cyberintrusions] are retaliatory.” Rather, as Russia finds itself struggling to stay afloat, “they are using cyber espionage to at least in part compensate for loss of competitiveness they are experiencing.” Alperovitch said the hacking has been tied to a single source, or “actor,” that CrowdStrike refers to as Cozy Bear.",
      "Three former U.S. intelligence officers who worked on counterintelligence and cyber operations told The Daily Beast that a new report this week accusing Russia of infiltrating unclassified networks at the White House was apparently designed to send a message to the Kremlin: We know what you’re up to, and how you’re doing it.",
      "With regards to attributing hacks to Russia, one of the former U.S. intelligence officials said that analysts have catalogued the specific tools Russian hackers use and have developed signatures that, he said, give analysts across the intelligence community confidence that Russia is a major source of cyber espionage.",
      "Beginning in March 2014, the Obama administration imposed a series of sanctions designed to punish Russia for its invasion of Crimea and subsequent military incursions in eastern Ukraine, and U.S. officials have said they’re helping to depress Russia’s economy, already hurting because of falling oil prices.",
      "In the past year, researchers have also linked Russian hackers believed to be working for the government to other spying campaigns, including against NATO, the Ukrainian government, energy companies in Poland, and an academic at an American university who was targeted because he studies Ukraine.",
      "Ever since the U.S. government hit Russia with economic sanctions last year, Russian hackers have started new cyberspying campaigns to steal information from U.S. government agencies and corporations, according to current and former American intelligence officials and cybersecurity experts.",
      "A former senior U.S. intelligence official told The Daily Beast that Russian hackers are among the best at posing as U.S. government employees or other trusted parties and then tricking others into disclosing login credentials that allow the hackers to get access to more computer networks.",
      "“We are seeing them across energy, finance and defense sectors, as well government agencies and national-security nonprofits.”\n\nClapper has spoken approvingly of the current sanctions regime and credits it with helping to depress the Russian economy and inflate the value of the ruble.",
      "Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Senate committee in February that “the Russian cyberthreat is more severe than we have previously assessed.” And last year, he twice singled out Russian hackers as among the most significant cyberthreats to the United States.",
      "In an interview with the Russian state-owned RIA Novotsi, Aleksandr Gostev of the Russian security company Kaspersky Labs said it would be “extremely difficult” to pin the activity on Russia, and noted that circumstantial evidence could be used to fabricate a case.",
      "On Tuesday, CNN reported that according to U.S. officials, Russian hackers had penetrated portions of the White House computer network by gaining access from another “perch,” at the State Department, where intruders had gotten inside the unclassified email system.",
      "In recent months, U.S. intelligence officials have been sounding the alarm about Russian hackers, who they see as more sophisticated and harder to track than their cohort in China, the other major source of cyberspying on the U.S. government and companies.",
      "Chinese cyberspying has tended to grab headlines, particularly after the Justice Department last year indicted five Chinese military officers for an espionage campaign targeting U.S. industries, including aluminum processors and solar-panel manufacturers.",
      "Disclosing the new details posed little risk to ongoing operations, the former officials said, because the hack had already been disclosed and it concerned sensitive materials—such as President Obama’s travel schedule—but not any classified information.",
      "“We are seeing a dramatic rise in cyber intrusion activity from the Russian government since the sanctions regime was put in place against them last year,” Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, told The Daily Beast.",
      "“We are literally tracking hundreds of breaches that they’ve been initiating against both government and commercial targets and have been battling and stopping their intrusion attempts at a number of our customers,” Alperovitch said.",
      "Last week, Obama signed an executive order that allows the U.S. to impose sanctions on individuals and entities for hacking that poses a “significant” threat to U.S. national security, including economic and financial stability.",
      "At the time, current and former officials told The Daily Beast that their confidence was based in large part on intelligence operations against North Korea that showed hackers in the Hermit Kingdom were hitting U.S. targets.",
      "A report in 2013 by the security research firm Critical Intelligence concluded that “Chinese adversaries” have infiltrated the networks of U.S. energy companies to steal information about fracking and gas extraction.",
      "“We know a lot about the Chinese only because they’re a lot noisier about it,” Clapper said, echoing remarks by other U.S. officials and experts who say that Chinese hackers seem not to care if they’re detected.",
      "Russia is “going to town on us and exploiting our information, our intellectual property,” Clapper said after a speech at the University of Texas in Austin last October.",
      "One former intelligence official read the information in the new report as “a veiled threat” to Russia that there could be further consequences for malicious hacking.",
      "CrowdStrike’s Alperovitch said Russian hacking over the past year has been targeting a broad range of industries, but all ones that are important to Russia’s economy.",
      "The report said Chinese hackers had also targeted companies that make petrochemicals, such as plastics, for which natural gas is a precursor ingredient.",
      "Rather, it was acknowledged by the White House last year after intruders accessed an unclassified network used by the Executive Office of the President.",
      "But, Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February, those measures still haven’t changed President Vladimir Putin’s strategy in Ukraine.",
      "“I worry, frankly, more about the Russians, who are a lot more subtle and a lot more sophisticated about purloining our information,” Clapper said.",
      "Nor have current U.S. officials offered any technical evidence that could support their claims of Russian hacking and be independently examined.",
      "Similar doubts about attributing hacks to foreign governments emerged when U.S. officials blamed North Korea for an attack on Sony last year.",
      "Russian military forces continue to back separatist rebels who have threatened to take more territory in the eastern portion of the country.",
      "Ultimately, President Obama and FBI Director James Comey publicly asserted that they were confident that North Korea was to blame.",
      "Alperovitch said it wasn’t clear whether the Russian hackers are working directly for the government or are contractors.",
      "(U.S. intelligence officials have noted that Moscow uses both its own hacking teams and outsources some work, as well.)",
      "Now, American officials are fighting back—by outing the hackers and issuing what some see as veiled threats to Moscow.",
      "Clapper also said the bigger threat to Russia’s financial stability was the low price of oil on the global market.",
      "The intrusion reported by CNN is not “a new incident,” a spokesman for the National Security Council said.",
      "“We are not configured collectively as as government and as a nation to defend against this as we should.”",
      "“We are confident they are working on behalf of the Russian intelligence agencies,” he said.",
      "“The greater impact frankly on the economy has been the drop in oil prices,” Clapper said.",
      "That could be another motivator for Russia to ramp up spying on U.S. energy companies.",
      "“It is a serious, serious problem,” he said during his remarks in Austin.",
      "In that respect, they may be borrowing a page from the Chinese playbook.",
      "And not everyone agrees that Moscow is behind the recent assaults.",
      "Alperovitch didn’t provide any technical details about the case.",
      "Certainly Clapper shares that view."

      "They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching “cyber Pearl Harbor” — a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks.",
      "And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications.",
      "Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this, but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly, or issue sanctions.",
      "They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States.",
      "A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it.",
      "There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia’s cooperation in negotiations over Syria.",
      "But in 2014 and 2015, a Russian hacking group began systematically targeting the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",

      "(Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)\n\nRussian goverment hackers penetrated the Democratic National Committee and had access to the DNC network for about a year, but all were expelled earlier in June.",
      "Some of the hackers had access to the DNC network for about a year, but all were expelled over the past weekend in a major computer cleanup campaign, the committee officials and experts said.",
      "“The security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the campaigns and state parties we work with,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), the DNC chairwoman.",
      "The DNC said that no financial, donor or personal information appears to have been accessed or taken, suggesting that the breach was traditional espionage, not the work of criminal hackers.",
      "CrowdStrike is less sure of whom Cozy Bear works for but thinks it might be the Federal Security Service, or FSB, the country’s powerful security agency, which was once headed by Putin.",
      "But unlike Clinton, whom the Russians probably have long had in their spy sights, Trump has not been a politician for very long, so foreign agencies are playing catch-up, analysts say.",
      "She also said, “So far as we know, my campaign has not been hacked into,” and added that cybersecurity is an issue that she “will be absolutely focused on” if she becomes president.",
      "“Trump’s foreign investments, for example, would be relevant to understanding how he would deal with countries where he has those investments” should he be elected, Deitz said.",
      "“Because whether it’s Russia, or China, Iran or North Korea, more and more countries are using hacking to steal our information, to use it to their advantage,” she said.",
      "“This is a sophisticated foreign intelligence service with a lot of time, a lot of resources, and is interested in targeting the U.S. political system,” Henry said.",
      "The intruders so thoroughly compromised the DNC’s system that they also were able to read all email and chat traffic, said DNC officials and the security experts.",
      "Russian goverment hackers penetrated the Democratic National Committee and had access to the DNC network for about a year, but all were expelled earlier in June.",
      "Within 24 hours, CrowdStrike had installed software on the DNC’s computers so that it could analyze data that could indicate who had gained access, when and how.",
      "“But at this time, it appears that no financial information or sensitive employee, donor or voter information was accessed by the Russian attackers,” he said.",
      "Cozy Bear, for instance, compromised the unclassified email systems of the White House, State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2014, Alperovitch said.",
      "Chief executive Amy Dacey got a call from her operations chief saying that their information technology team had noticed some unusual network activity.",
      "The firm has installed special software on every computer and server in the network to detect any efforts by the Russian cyberspies to break in again.",
      "And Russia’s growing isolation has increased the need for intelligence to understand and influence political decisions in other countries, he added.",
      "“When they get kicked out of the system,” Henry predicted, “they’re going to try to come back in.”\n\nTom Hamburger contributed to this report.",
      "He noted that it is extremely difficult for a civilian organization to protect itself from a skilled and determined state such as Russia.",
      "“Their job when they wake up every day is to gather intelligence against the policies, practices and strategies of the U.S. government.",
      "Soon after, Sussmann, a former federal prosecutor who handled computer crime cases, called Henry, whom he has known for many years.",
      "The other, which the firm had named Fancy Bear, broke into the network in late April and targeted the opposition research files.",
      "They’re all vying for power, to sell Putin on how good they are.”\n\nThe two crews have “superb operational tradecraft,” he said.",
      "“When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately.",
      "Donald Trump has repeatedly called Vladimir Putin a \"strong\" leader, but toes a fine line on praising the Russian president.",
      "And they had access to the computers of the entire research staff — an average of about several dozen on any given day.",

      "“You’ve got ordinary citizens who are doing hand-to-hand combat with trained military officers,” he said.",
      "“There’s an amazing adversarial relationship” among the Russian intelligence agencies, Alperovitch said.",
      "“It’s a huge job” to dig into the dealings of somebody who has never run for office before, Dacey said.",
      "“It’s never a call any executive wants to get, but the IT team knew something was awry,” ­Dacey said.",
      "Nonetheless, DNC leadership acted quickly after the intrusion’s discovery to contain the damage.",

      "The depth of the penetration reflects the skill and determination of the United States’ top cyber-adversary as Russia goes after strategic targets, from the White House and State Department to political campaign organizations.",
      "In the DNC’s case, the hackers constantly switched tactics to maintain a stealthy presence inside the network and used built-in Windows tools so that they didn’t have to resort to malicious code that might trigger alerts.",
      "[U.S. suspects Russia in hack of Pentagon computer network]\n\nOne group, which CrowdStrike had dubbed Cozy Bear, had gained access last summer and was monitoring the DNC’s email and chat communications, Alperovitch said.",
      "Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network.”\n\n[Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s Worst Week in Washington]\n\nClinton called the intrusion “troubling” in an interview with Telemundo.",
      "“The purpose of such intelligence gathering is to understand the target’s proclivities,” said Robert Deitz, former senior councillor to the CIA director and\n\na former general counsel at\n\nthe National Security Agency.",
      "1 of 45 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail View Photos Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party’s convention in Cleveland.",
      "The two groups have hacked government agencies, tech companies, defense contractors, energy and manufacturing firms, and universities in the United States, Canada and Europe as well as in Asia, he said.",
      "The firm identified two separate hacker groups, both working for the Russian government, that had infiltrated the network, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike co-founder and chief technology officer.",
      "The networks of presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were also targeted by Russian spies, as were the computers of some Republican political action committees, U.S. officials said.",
      "(Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)\n\nRussian goverment hackers penetrated the Democratic National Committee and had access to the DNC network for about a year, but all were expelled earlier in June.",
      "Some of the hackers had access to the DNC network for about a year, but all were expelled over the past weekend in a major computer cleanup campaign, the committee officials and experts said.",
      "“The security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the campaigns and state parties we work with,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), the DNC chairwoman.",
      "The DNC said that no financial, donor or personal information appears to have been accessed or taken, suggesting that the breach was traditional espionage, not the work of criminal hackers.",
      "CrowdStrike is less sure of whom Cozy Bear works for but thinks it might be the Federal Security Service, or FSB, the country’s powerful security agency, which was once headed by Putin.",
      "But unlike Clinton, whom the Russians probably have long had in their spy sights, Trump has not been a politician for very long, so foreign agencies are playing catch-up, analysts say.",
      "She also said, “So far as we know, my campaign has not been hacked into,” and added that cybersecurity is an issue that she “will be absolutely focused on” if she becomes president.",
      "“Trump’s foreign investments, for example, would be relevant to understanding how he would deal with countries where he has those investments” should he be elected, Deitz said.",
      "“Because whether it’s Russia, or China, Iran or North Korea, more and more countries are using hacking to steal our information, to use it to their advantage,” she said.",
      "“This is a sophisticated foreign intelligence service with a lot of time, a lot of resources, and is interested in targeting the U.S. political system,” Henry said.",
      "The intruders so thoroughly compromised the DNC’s system that they also were able to read all email and chat traffic, said DNC officials and the security experts.",
      "Russian goverment hackers penetrated the Democratic National Committee and had access to the DNC network for about a year, but all were expelled earlier in June.",
      "Within 24 hours, CrowdStrike had installed software on the DNC’s computers so that it could analyze data that could indicate who had gained access, when and how.",
      "“But at this time, it appears that no financial information or sensitive employee, donor or voter information was accessed by the Russian attackers,” he said.",
      "Cozy Bear, for instance, compromised the unclassified email systems of the White House, State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2014, Alperovitch said.",
      "Chief executive Amy Dacey got a call from her operations chief saying that their information technology team had noticed some unusual network activity.",
      "The firm has installed special software on every computer and server in the network to detect any efforts by the Russian cyberspies to break in again.",
      "And Russia’s growing isolation has increased the need for intelligence to understand and influence political decisions in other countries, he added.",
      "“When they get kicked out of the system,” Henry predicted, “they’re going to try to come back in.”\n\nTom Hamburger contributed to this report.",
      "He noted that it is extremely difficult for a civilian organization to protect itself from a skilled and determined state such as Russia.",
      "“Their job when they wake up every day is to gather intelligence against the policies, practices and strategies of the U.S. government.",
      "Soon after, Sussmann, a former federal prosecutor who handled computer crime cases, called Henry, whom he has known for many years.",
      "The other, which the firm had named Fancy Bear, broke into the network in late April and targeted the opposition research files.",
      "They’re all vying for power, to sell Putin on how good they are.”\n\nThe two crews have “superb operational tradecraft,” he said.",
      "“When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately.",
      "Donald Trump has repeatedly called Vladimir Putin a \"strong\" leader, but toes a fine line on praising the Russian president.",
      "And they had access to the computers of the entire research staff — an average of about several dozen on any given day.",
      "They often use previously unknown software bugs — known as “zero-day” vulnerabilities — to compromise applications.",
      "Caption Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party’s convention in Cleveland.",
      "[How Russian special forces are shaping the fight in Syria]\n\nThe lack of coordination is not unusual, he said.",
      "That evening, she spoke with Michael Sussmann, a DNC lawyer who is a partner with Perkins Coie in Washington.",
      "“You’ve got ordinary citizens who are doing hand-to-hand combat with trained military officers,” he said.",
      "“There’s an amazing adversarial relationship” among the Russian intelligence agencies, Alperovitch said.",
      "“It’s a huge job” to dig into the dealings of somebody who has never run for office before, Dacey said.",
      "“It’s never a call any executive wants to get, but the IT team knew something was awry,” ­Dacey said.",
      "Nonetheless, DNC leadership acted quickly after the intrusion’s discovery to contain the damage.",
      "Fancy Bear is believed to work for the GRU, or Russia’s military intelligence service, he said.",
      "(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n“We’re perceived as an adversary of Russia,” he said.",
      "The intrusion into the DNC was one of several targeting American political organizations.",
      "CrowdStrike is continuing the forensic investigation, said Sussmann, the DNC lawyer.",
      "The firm suspects they may have targeted DNC employees with “spearphishing” emails.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign referred questions to the Secret Service.",
      "Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at Trump Doral golf course in Miami.",
      "The firm had analyzed other breaches by both groups over the past two years.",
      "And they knew it was serious enough that they wanted experts to investigate.",
      "“We have seen them steal assets from one another, refuse to collaborate.",
      "The two groups did not appear to be working together, Alperovitch said.",
      "“They may provide tips for understanding his style of negotiating.",
      "The computers contained research going back years on Trump.",
      "Carlo Allegri/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.",
      "“But we don’t have hard evidence,” Alperovitch said.",
      "DNC leaders were tipped to the hack in late April.",
      "He said the DNC was not engaged in a fair fight.",
      "CrowdStrike is not sure how the hackers got in.",
      "“They flew under the radar,” Alperovitch said.",
      "But details on those cases were not available.",
      "It was this breach that set off the alarm.",
      "The hackers stole two files, Henry said.",
      "There are a variety of ways."

      "In particular, we identified advanced methods consistent with nation-state level capabilities including deliberate targeting and ‘access management’ tradecraft – both groups were constantly going back into the environment to change out their implants, modify persistent methods, move to new Command & Control channels and perform other tasks to try to stay ahead of being detected.",
      "Follow @CrowdStrike and @DAlperovitch for the latest on these threats\n\nUPDATE:\n\nBelow are some additional links to independent articles that have been published since our original blog:\n\nJune 15, 2016 UPDATE:\n\nCrowdStrike stands fully by its analysis and findings identifying two separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries present in the DNC network in May 2016.",
      "The COZY BEAR intrusion relied primarily on the SeaDaddy implant developed in Python and compiled with py2exe and another Powershell backdoor with persistence accomplished via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) system, which allowed the adversary to launch malicious code automatically after a specified period of system uptime or on a specific schedule.",
      "This adversary has a wide range of implants at their disposal, which have been developed over the course of many years and include Sofacy, X-Agent, X-Tunnel, WinIDS, Foozer and DownRange droppers, and even malware for Linux, OSX, IOS, Android and Windows Phones.",
      "But on rare occasions, a customer decides to go public with information about their incident and give us permission to share our knowledge of the adversary tradecraft with the broader community and help protect even those who do not happen to be our customers.",
      "FANCY BEAR (also known as Sofacy or APT 28) is a separate Russian-based threat actor, which has been active since mid 2000s, and has been responsible for targeted intrusion campaigns against the Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Government and Media sectors.",
      "Both adversaries engage in extensive political and economic espionage for the benefit of the government of the Russian Federation and are believed to be closely linked to the Russian government’s powerful and highly capable intelligence services.",
      "In addition to the US government, they have targeted organizations across the Defense, Energy, Extractive, Financial, Insurance, Legal, Manufacturing Media, Think Tanks, Pharmaceutical, Research and Technology industries, along with Universities.",
      "These actions demonstrate a well-resourced adversary with a thorough implant-testing regime that is highly attuned to slight configuration issues that may result in their detection, and which would cause them to deploy a different tool instead.",
      "The implants are highly configurable via encrypted configuration files, which allow the adversary to customize various components, including C2 servers, the list of initial tasks to carry out, persistence mechanisms, encryption keys and others.",
      "It was executed via rundll32 commands such as:\n\nrundll32.exe “C:\\Windows\\twain_64.dll”\n\nIn addition, FANCY BEAR’s X-Tunnel network tunneling tool, which facilitates connections to NAT-ed environments, was used to also execute remote commands.",
      "“Putin’s Hydra: Inside Russia’s Intelligence Services”, a recent paper from European Council on Foreign Relations, does an excellent job outlining the highly adversarial relationship between Russia’s main intelligence services – ???????????",
      "COZY BEAR (also referred to in some industry reports as CozyDuke or APT 29) is the adversary group that last year successfully infiltrated the unclassified networks of the White House, State Department, and US Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "Extensive targeting of defense ministries and other military victims has been observed, the profile of which closely mirrors the strategic interests of the Russian government, and may indicate affiliation with ???????",
      "While you would virtually never see Western intelligence agencies going after the same target without de-confliction for fear of compromising each other’s operations, in Russia this is not an uncommon scenario.",
      "CrowdStrike Services Inc., our Incident Response group, was called by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body for the US Democratic Party, to respond to a suspected breach.",
      "On many occasions, both the dropper and the payload will contain a range of techniques to ensure the sample is not being analyzed on a virtual machine, using a debugger, or located within a sandbox.",
      "Thus, it is not surprising to see them engage in intrusions against the same victim, even when it may be a waste of resources and lead to the discovery and potential compromise of mutual operations.",
      "Regardless of the agency or unit tasked with this collection, the upcoming US election, and the associated candidates and parties are of critical interest to both hostile and friendly nation states.",
      "Regardless, these claims do nothing to lessen our findings relating to the Russian government’s involvement, portions of which we have documented for the public and the greater security community.",
      "They also engaged in a number of anti-forensic analysis measures, such as periodic event log clearing (via wevtutil cl System and wevtutil cl Security commands) and resetting timestamps of files.",
      "Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to none and the extensive usage of ‘living-off-the-land’ techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter.",
      "Not only do they have overlapping areas of responsibility, but also rarely share intelligence and even occasionally steal sources from each other and compromise operations.",
      "In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis.",
      "On June 15, 2016 a blog post to a WordPress site authored by an individual using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 claimed credit for breaching the Democratic National Committee.",
      "Afterwards, they establish phishing sites on these domains that spoof the look and feel of the victim’s web-based email services in order to steal their credentials.",
      "Intelligence collection directed by nation state actors against US political targets provides invaluable insight into the requirements directed upon those actors.",
      "Once executed on the machine, the code will deliver one of a number of sophisticated Remote Access Tools (RATs), including AdobeARM, ATI-Agent, and MiniDionis.",
      "FANCY BEAR adversary used different tradecraft, deploying X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging.",
      "In all of these cases, we operate under strict confidentiality rules with our customers and cannot reveal publicly any information about these attacks.",
      "Powershell version of credential theft tool MimiKatz was also used by the actors to facilitate credential acquisition for lateral movement purposes.",
      "The 2016 presidential election has the world’s attention, and leaders of other states are anxiously watching and planning for possible outcomes.",
      "Whether or not this posting is part of a Russian Intelligence disinformation campaign, we are exploring the documents’ authenticity and origin.",

      "Instead, we observed the two Russian espionage groups compromise the same systems and engage separately in the theft of identical credentials.",
      "At DNC, COZY BEAR intrusion has been identified going back to summer of 2015, while FANCY BEAR separately breached the network in April 2016.",
      "This group is known for its technique of registering domains that closely resemble domains of legitimate organizations they plan to target.",
      "COZY BEAR’s preferred intrusion method is a broadly targeted spearphish campaign that typically includes web links to a malicious dropper.",
      "We deployed our IR team and technology and immediately identified two sophisticated adversaries on the network – COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR.",
      "There is rarely a dull day at CrowdStrike where we are not detecting or responding to a breach at a company somewhere around the globe.",

      "They have extensive checks for the various security software that is installed on the system and their specific configurations.",
      "Attacks against electoral candidates and the parties they represent are likely to continue up until the election in November.",

      "It is also likely that there are other work-related e-mails that they did not produce to State and that we did not find elsewhere, and that are now gone because they deleted all e-mails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery.",
      "While not the focus of our investigation, we also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified e-mail systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government.",
      "Because she was not using a government account—or even a commercial account like Gmail—there was no archiving at all of her e-mails, so it is not surprising that we discovered e-mails that were not on Secretary Clinton’s system in 2014, when she produced the 30,000 e-mails to the State Department.",
      "Although we do not have complete visibility because we are not able to fully reconstruct the electronic record of that sorting, we believe our investigation has been sufficient to give us reasonable confidence there was no intentional misconduct in connection with that sorting effort.",
      "There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.",
      "Others we found by reviewing the archived government e-mail accounts of people who had been government employees at the same time as Secretary Clinton, including high-ranking officials at other agencies, people with whom a Secretary of State might naturally correspond.",
      "With respect to the thousands of e-mails we found that were not among those produced to State, agencies have concluded that three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received, one at the Secret level and two at the Confidential level.",
      "In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found information that was properly classified as Secret by the U.S. Intelligence Community at the time it was discussed on e-mail (that is, excluding the later “up-classified” e-mails).",
      "Consistent with our counterintelligence responsibilities, we have also investigated to determine whether there is evidence of computer intrusion in connection with the personal e-mail server by any foreign power, or other hostile actors.",
      "Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification.",
      "Although we don’t normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence.",
      "So, first, what we have done:\n\nThe investigation began as a referral from the Intelligence Community Inspector General in connection with Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State.",
      "Piecing all of that back together—to gain as full an understanding as possible of the ways in which personal e-mail was used for government work—has been a painstaking undertaking, requiring thousands of hours of effort.",
      "From the group of 30,000 e-mails returned to the State Department, 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received.",
      "Finally, none of those we found have since been “up-classified.”\n\nI should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.",
      "It could also be that some of the additional work-related e-mails we recovered were among those deleted as “personal” by Secretary Clinton’s lawyers when they reviewed and sorted her e-mails for production in 2014.",
      "Secretary Clinton used several different servers and administrators of those servers during her four years at the State Department, and used numerous mobile devices to view and send e-mail on that personal domain.",
      "With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked.",
      "Finally, with respect to our recommendation to the Department of Justice:\n\nIn our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect.",
      "Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.",
      "It is highly likely their search terms missed some work-related e-mails, and that we later found them, for example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server.",
      "Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.",
      "First, I am going to include more detail about our process than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest.",
      "She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries.",
      "We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account.",
      "In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.",
      "As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case.",
      "But even if information is not marked “classified” in an e-mail, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.",
      "After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the FBI is completing its investigation and referring the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision.",
      "Last, we have done extensive work to understand what indications there might be of compromise by hostile actors in connection with the personal e-mail operation.",
      "Our assessment is that, like many e-mail users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted e-mails or e-mails were purged from the system when devices were changed.",
      "The FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014.",
      "I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation—including people in government—but none of that mattered to us.",
      "Still others we recovered from the laborious review of the millions of e-mail fragments dumped into the slack space of the server decommissioned in 2013.",
      "Doing that didn’t remove the e-mail content, but it was like removing the frame from a huge finished jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor.",
      "I’m here to give you an update on the FBI’s investigation of Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail system during her time as Secretary of State.",
      "For example, seven e-mail chains concern matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received.",
      "FBI investigators have also read all of the approximately 30,000 e-mails provided by Secretary Clinton to the State Department in December 2014.",
      "What I would like to do today is tell you three things: what we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice.",
      "Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account.",
      "But, given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence.",
      "Only a very small number of the e-mails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information.",
      "These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending e-mails about those matters and receiving e-mails from others about the same matters.",
      "Some had been deleted over the years and we found traces of them on devices that supported or were connected to the private e-mail domain.",
      "Second, I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government.",
      "We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent.",
      "Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way.",
      "To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences.",
      "For example, when one of Secretary Clinton’s original personal servers was decommissioned in 2013, the e-mail software was removed.",
      "As new servers and equipment were employed, older servers were taken out of service, stored, and decommissioned in various ways.",
      "We have conducted interviews and done technical examination to attempt to understand how that sorting was done by her attorneys.",
      "Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.",
      "Once you have a better sense of how much we have done, you will understand why I am so grateful and proud of their efforts.",
      "I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout this investigation.",
      "What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently.",
      "I have so far used the singular term, “e-mail server,” in describing the referral that began our investigation.",
      "We searched through all of it to see what was there, and what parts of the puzzle could be put back together.",
      "The effect was that millions of e-mail fragments end up unsorted in the server’s unused—or “slack”—space.",
      "There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.",
      "The referral focused on whether classified information was transmitted on that personal system.",
      "Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way.",
      "To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions.",
      "This helped us recover work-related e-mails that were not among the 30,000 produced to State.",
      "In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order.",
      "Separately, it is important to say something about the marking of classified information.",
      "I want to start by thanking the FBI employees who did remarkable work in this case.",
      "Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges.",
      "This will be an unusual statement in at least a couple ways.",
      "We found those additional e-mails in a variety of ways.",
      "I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this organization.",
      "No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear.",
      "It turns out to have been more complicated than that.",
      "There were no additional Top Secret e-mails found.",
      "Remarks prepared for delivery at press briefing.",
      "But that is not what we are deciding now.",
      "They do not know what I am about to say.",
      "We do not see those things here.",
      "That’s what we have done.",
      "So that’s what we found.",
      "Good morning."

      "Where an e-mail was assessed as possibly containing classified information, the FBI referred the e-mail to any U.S. government agency that was a likely “owner” of information in the e-mail, so that agency could make a determination as to whether the e-mail contained classified information at the time it was sent or received, or whether there was reason to classify the e-mail now, even if its content was not classified at the time it was sent (that is the process sometimes referred to as “up-classifying”).",
      "Our investigation looked at whether there is evidence classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on that personal system, in violation of a federal statute making it a felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities.",
      "The lawyers doing the sorting for Secretary Clinton in 2014 did not individually read the content of all of her e-mails, as we did for those available to us; instead, they relied on header information and used search terms to try to find all work-related e-mails among the reportedly more than 60,000 total e-mails remaining on Secretary Clinton’s personal system in 2014.",
      "None of these e-mails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these e-mails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at Departments and Agencies of the U.S. Government—or even with a commercial service like Gmail.",
      "And, of course, in addition to our technical work, we interviewed many people, from those involved in setting up and maintaining the various iterations of Secretary Clinton’s personal server, to staff members with whom she corresponded on e-mail, to those involved in the e-mail production to State, and finally, Secretary Clinton herself.",
      "All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice.",

      "And that is why many, many months ago, I made it clear that I thought Debbie Wasserman Schultz should resign, should step down, not only because of the prejudice I think they showed during the campaign, but also because I think we need a new leadership of the Democratic Party which is going to open up that party to working people, to young people, to have the kind of vitality we need to not only win the presidency, but gain control of the Senate and the House as well.",
      "My second message is that we continue the political revolution and fight for a government that represents all of us, and not just the 1 percent, fight to break up the banks on Wall Street, fight for a Medicare-for-all single-payer system, fight to rebuild our infrastructure and create millions of decent jobs, fight for real criminal justice and immigration reform.",
      "Hillary Clinton and I reached an agreement on a higher education plan that would guarantee free tuition at public -- every public college and university in this country for families making 125,000 bucks or less, greatly expanding health care, and making sure that we make sure that millions of people gain access to primary health care and dental care.",

      "Doesn't the Democratic Party, doesn't the Hillary Clinton campaign run a risk, if you go after the stark picture that Donald Trump painted, if you belittle it, don't you run the risk of alienating people who are concerned about trade deals that sent their jobs away, illegal immigration, crime, terrorism?",

      "TRUMP JR.: Listen, I don't know what he's going to do, I'm not a policy wonk in terms of what we are going to decide to do, but I think we have to acknowledge that there's those numbers and then there is the real situation and they are very different.",

      "TAPPER: So, I have to ask, what is the reaction of the Clinton campaign to these DNC leaked e-mails suggesting that top officials, including the CFO there, were actively discussing ways to hurt Bernie Sanders in the primaries?",
      "And, again, I think it's -- if the Russians in fact had these e-mails, again, I don't think it's very coincidental that they are being released at this time to create maximum damage on Hillary Clinton and to help Donald Trump.",
      "I'm just concerned that you've got a tone deaf DNC chair, Robby should not have said that and I'm just worried that we are not respecting -- you have 43 percent of the delegates coming here, they are Bernie Sanders people.",
      "I don't think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC, not only for these awful e-mails, which revealed the prejudice of the DNC, but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people.",
      "President Obama weighed in saying -- quote -- \"this idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere doesn't really jive with the experience of most people\" -- unquote.",
      "We're live on the floor of the Democratic National Convention here in Philadelphia, PA. Lots of folks were expecting fewer fireworks here than at Donald Trump's convention, which, of course, featured actual fireworks.",

      "If you don't speak Spanish what he said was, welcome everyone to our country because we are all Americans, as kind of a pointed jab at Donald Trump, big question of course will it translate to votes?",
      "Obviously, Bakari is very loyal, but he he's -- he said that beforehand, so I can't help but suspect that he's disappointed, as, are we know, many Latinos that yet again we have an all-white ticket.",
      "[09:20:20]\n\n\n\nSo, my focus right now is defeating Trump, electing Clinton, electing progressive candidates around this country, and focusing on the issues that matter the most to working families.",

      "I don't mind a fair fight, but these lies and the perpetuating of that kind of nonsense to try, you know, gain some political capital is just outrageous and he should be ashamed of himself.",
      "I think that what Robby was trying to say is that a lot of people are really excited about Tim Kaine's selection, you know, this is a person who was a civil rights lawyer for 17 years.",
      "Those are the people that can't feed their families and we're telling them that they're employed because some bureaucrat (INAUDIBLE) says, well, this is the way the numbers work (ph).",
      "It was exciting to be able to have a platform like that to speak my voice because as you can hear from this interview I'm really frustrated with what's going on in this country, Jake.",
      "When you talk about underemployment which Obamacare has destroyed, people that are working 30 hours a week instead of 40 hours a week so companies don't have to put them on Obamacare.",

      "I think we need to be concerned that we also saw last week at the Republican Convention that Trump and his allies made changes to the Republican platform to make it more pro-Russian.",
      "I think, again, the talking heads and a lot of the people within the parties are missing the Bernie folks and the Trump folks and they are not getting them on their radar to digest.",
      "I'm not badmouthing him, he is a nice guy, I just don't think he reaches out and grabs any Trump voters, any independents, any moderates, any folks that are looking at Gary Johnson.",
      "I mean,\n\n\n\nthere's no question to my mind and I think no question to any objective observer's mind that the DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton, was in opposition to our campaign.",

      "For example, on Feb. 10, 2015, he compared the 2015 National Security Strategy rationale for imposing sanctions on Russia to an 1850 publication offering slaveholders guidance on how to produce “the ideal slave.”\n\nAfter the Obama administration added Rosneft Chairman Igor Sechin to its sanctions list in 2014, limiting Sechin’s ability to travel to the United States or do business with U.S. firms, Page praised the former deputy prime minister, considered one of Putin’s closest allies over the past 25 years.",
      "He called Page’s speech in Moscow and recent comments by Trump on the possibility of lifting sanctions against Moscow “deeply unsettling.”\n\nAsked to comment on Page’s public statements and campaign role, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Page was an “informal foreign policy adviser” who “does not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.” Trump first named Page as one of a handful of his foreign policy advisers during a meeting at The Washington Post.",
      "He said the United States should provide Russia with “emerging technologies and potential capital market access contingent upon the U.S.’s refocus toward resolution of domestic challenges.” Russia would, in turn, approve “collaborative partnerships in the energy industry and other diversified sectors.”\n\n“So many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy,” Page told Bloomberg News.",
      "He also said that no one at Merrill Lynch advised Gazprom on its purchase of Sakhalin oil and gas assets from a group led by Royal Dutch Shell, because the deal was driven by the Russian government, which strong-armed Shell by holding back environmental permits, complaining about the extent of local content and slowing Shell’s work to a crawl.",
      "(The Washington Post)\n\nRelationship with Gazprom\n\nA graduate of the Naval Academy later posted as a Marine intelligence officer in Western Sahara, Page won a fellowship from the Council on Foreign Relations, where he wrote about Turkey’s role as a hub for oil and natural gas being taken by pipeline from the Caspian Sea region to Europe.",
      "In a two-hour interview with Bloomberg News in late March, he said he advised Gazprom on its largest deals, including buying a stake in an oil and natural gas field near Russia’s Sakhalin Island and the merging of two classes of Gazprom stock, one of which was restricted to foreigners and the other to Russians.",
      "Trump has also expressed admiration for Putin, questioned U.S. obligations to defend NATO allies and most recently — after hacked emails were released on the eve of the Democratic National Convention — asked for Russian help to find the deleted emails of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.",
      "(Pavel Golovkin/AP)\n\nIn early June, a little-known adviser to Donald Trump stunned a gathering of high-powered Washington foreign policy experts meeting with the visiting prime minister of India, going off topic with effusive praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump.",
      "The adviser, Carter Page, hailed Putin as stronger and more reliable than President Obama, according to three people who were present at the closed-door meeting at Blair House — and then touted the positive effect a Trump presidency would have on U.S.-Russia relations.",
      "But since being named to the Republican nominee’s team in March, his stature within the foreign policy world has grown considerably, drawing alarm from more-established foreign policy experts who view him as having little real understanding about U.S.-Russia relations.",
      "(Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)\n\nOther foreign policy experts from both parties say they are distressed with Page for his criticism of sanctions, praise for Putin and his advisers, and his tepid response to what most U.S. policymakers see as Russian aggression.",
      "Aleksashenko said when he heard that Trump named Page as an adviser, “I was laughing because he was never ready to discuss foreign policy.”\n\nAfter he left Moscow, Page worked as chief operating officer of Merrill Lynch’s energy and power department in New York.",
      "Page’s position as a Trump adviser has catapulted him into the most prestigious policy events, such as a closed-door session co-chaired by former secretary of state Madeleine K. Albright and Republican consultant Vin Weber at Cambridge University in July.",
      "The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), has said that the Russian ties of Trump’s advisers show that the “Kremlin has tentacles into the Trump campaign.”\n\nMeanwhile, in Moscow, all this is being watched closely.",
      "During his interview with Bloomberg News, he said that he owns shares of Gazprom and that his stock portfolio had suffered since 2014, when the United States and Europe imposed economic sanctions on Russia after its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "“Yet ironically, Washington and other Western capitals have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.”\n\nPage has an ambiguous role in Trump’s campaign.",
      "Another blog post on March 31, 2015, titled “ISIS Response Self-help Principles for Would-be Warriors of the West” approvingly cites Dale Carnegie’s classic “How to Win Friends and Influence People” as a strategy for dealing with the Islamic State.",
      "“I think what we are offering is a very clear, mature, adult, realistic view of the world,” said Sam Clovis, an Iowa talk-show host and former Senate candidate who backs Trump and makes the case for rethinking U.S. commitments around the globe.",
      "After his speech at the New Economic School in Moscow, Page spoke briefly with another speaker, Arkady Dvorkovich, who is a graduate of the school, deputy to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and now chairman of the Russian Railways board.",
      "“There’s a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.” While acknowledging his own investments in Russia, Page told Bloomberg News his work on the campaign was unlikely to help his portfolio.",
      "McFaul, who reviewed Page’s early July speech in Moscow, said he disagreed with the content and added that he knew of no precedent for a presidential campaign adviser publicly criticizing U.S. policy in a foreign capital.",
      "The United States and other Western nations have “criticized these regions for continuing methods which were prevalent during the Cold War period,” Page said in a lecture at the New Economic School commencement.",
      "‘Refreshing to Russian ears’\n\nTrump is not the first national political figure to suggest improved relations with Russia; Obama and Clinton advocated a “reset” a few years ago, which they have since abandoned.",
      "While his comments have drawn derision from some quarters, friends of the 45-year-old Page say that he is knowledgeable about Russian affairs, and they profess astonishment that he has chosen to advise Trump.",
      "“I think Donald Trump is a very interesting internal American phenomenon,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs and chairman of the presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy.",
      "In the past, that would not be considered a controversial Republican position.”\n\nManafort denied on “Meet the Press” this week that the campaign had sought to alter platform language related to Russia.",
      "Page, who worked in Moscow for Merrill Lynch a decade ago and who has said he is invested in Gazprom, joins other Trump advisers who have done business in Russia while advocating closer relations.",
      "“It was troubling to me that they would want to water down language that supports a country that has been invaded by an aggressive neighbor,” said Rachel Hoff, a member of the platform committee.",
      "The open embrace of a controversial foreign leader is unusual for an adviser to a presidential candidate — and a break from a decades-old Republican tradition of tough stances­ toward Moscow.",
      "All holdings in Russia by members of the Trump team should be fully disclosed, said Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia under Obama who is now teaching at Stanford University.",
      "The Republican platform committee at the party’s convention last month was one place Trump campaign aides have promoted that view, according to national security experts who were there.",
      "Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for example, has wooed investments from oligarchs linked to Putin and advised the now-toppled pro-Russian Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.",
      "Page also went to the Republican National Convention, where he attended a session held by the International Republican Institute and a separate, sponsored foreign policy event.",
      "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said the United States gets \"no respect\" from Russian President Vladimir Putin during a town hall event in Scranton, Pa., July 27.",
      "“It was not a commercially driven transaction.”\n\nMerrill Lynch was one of three firms that issued a fairness opinion on the price Gazprom eventually paid the Shell group.",
      "Sergey Aleksashenko, former deputy chairman of the Russian central bank and former chairman of Merrill Lynch Russia, says that Page did not play a key role at that time.",
      "“Sechin has done more to advance U.S.-Russian relations than any individual in or out of government from either side of the Atlantic over the past decade,” Page wrote.",
      "If he by chance were elected president, I think many people in Russia would love it.”\n\nRosalind S. Helderman, Will Englund and Andrew Roth contributed to this report.",
      "Page has offered that experience as one of his main areas of expertise, but his boss at Merrill Lynch at the time says that Page’s claims are exaggerated.",
      "Carter Page, an adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, speaks at the graduation ceremony for the New Economic School in Moscow, July 8.",
      "Since being named as a member of the Trump team in March, Page’s background in Russia has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest.",
      "He said that in July, Page had not established contacts with the Kremlin and had only met with some university professors for informal coffees.",
      "“It scares me,” said David Kramer, who was responsible for Russia and Ukraine at the State Department during the George W. Bush administration.",
      "After earning a degree from New York University’s business school, Page moved in 2004 to Moscow, where he worked for Merrill Lynch until 2007.",
      "A month later, Page dumbfounded foreign policy experts again by giving another speech harshly critical of U.S. policy — this time in Moscow.",
      "Page, who declined to comment for this article, has said in other media interviews that he also struck up a relationship with Gazprom.",
      "His Web biography says he was an adviser “on key transactions for Gazprom,” the Russian electric utility and other energy companies.",
      "Page has left a trail of blog posts on the Global Policy Journal that has traditional foreign policy experts scratching their heads.",
      "But he is the first to cast doubt on NATO’s mutual defense commitment or to request help from Russia in undermining his opponent.",
      "At the time he spoke, the FBI was investigating a break-in at the Democratic National Committee by alleged Russian hackers.",
      "“He was a vice president, and the job of vice president is not to organize deals but to execute,” Aleksashenko said.",
      "But he told Bloomberg News that he failed to raise money for a private-equity fund to buy assets in Turkmenistan.",
      "They said Trump campaign staffers weakened language that would have called for military support of Ukraine.",
      "Democrats, however, have suggested something more sinister lies behind Trump’s unusual views on Russia.",
      "Many also say that Page’s views may be compromised by his investment in Russian energy giant Gazprom.",
      "Instead, he says on his website that he advised others on investing in Russia and emerging markets.",
      "However, those present said they negotiated directly with people who worked for the campaign.",
      "In his Moscow speech in July, Page suggested that investment was the key to better relations.",
      "Trump is also not alone in seeking more military spending from U.S. allies in Europe.",
      "Later, he set up Global Energy Capital, which is around the corner from Trump Tower.",
      "“I think the U.S. should properly come to Ukraine’s aid in that struggle.",
      "“I don’t think he has any direct support here,” Lukyanov said of Trump.",
      "“What he’s saying sounds very much refreshing to Russian ears.",
      "“Gazprom did not need any advice,” Aleksashenko said.",

      "The assessment concluded with high confidence that the Kremlin ordered an extensive, multi-pronged propaganda effort “to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.”\n\nThat review did not attempt to assess what effect the Russian efforts had on the election, despite the fact that “Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards.” According to the Department of Homeland Security, the assessment reported reassuringly, “the types of systems we observed Russian actors targeting or compromising are not involved in vote tallying.”\n\nThe NSA has now learned, however, that Russian government hackers, part of a team with a “cyber espionage mandate specifically directed at U.S. and foreign elections,” focused on parts of the system directly connected to the voter registration process, including a private sector manufacturer of devices that maintain and verify the voter rolls.",
      "The NSA assessed that this phase of the spear-fishing operation was likely launched on either October 31 or November 1 and sent spear-fishing emails to 122 email addresses “associated with named local government organizations,” probably to officials “involved in the management of voter registration systems.” The emails contained Microsoft Word attachments purporting to be benign documentation for VR Systems’ EViD voter database product line, but which were in reality maliciously embedded with automated software commands that are triggered instantly and invisibly when the user opens the document.",
      "“This could affect whether someone has the ability to cast a regular ballot, or be required to cast a ‘provisional’ ballot — which would mean it has to be checked for their eligibility before it is included in the vote, and it may mean the voter has to jump through certain hoops such as proving their information to the election official before their eligibility is affirmed.”\n\nMark Graff, a digital security consultant and former chief cybersecurity officer at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, described such a hypothetical tactic as “effectively a denial of service attack” against would-be voters.",
      "“Once the user opens up that email [attachment],” Williams explained, “the attacker has all the same capabilities that the user does.” Vikram Thakur, a senior research manager at Symantec’s Security Response Team, told The Intercept that in cases like this the “quantity of exfiltrated data is only limited by the controls put in place by network administrators.” Data theft of this variety is typically encrypted, meaning anyone observing an infected network wouldn’t be able to see what exactly was being removed but should certainly be able to tell something was afoot, Williams added.",
      "If opened, the files “very likely” would have instructed the infected computer to begin downloading in the background a second package of malware from a remote server also controlled by the hackers, which the secret report says could have provided attackers with “persistent access” to the computer or the ability to “survey the victims for items of interest.” Essentially, the weaponized Word document quietly unlocks and opens a target’s back door, allowing virtually any cocktail of malware to be subsequently delivered automatically.",
      "Two months later, on October 27, they set up an “operational” Gmail account designed to appear as if it belonged to an employee at VR Systems, and used documents obtained from the previous operation to launch a second spear-phishing operation “targeting U.S. local government organizations.” These emails contained a Microsoft Word document that had been “trojanized” so that when it was opened it would send out a beacon to the “malicious infrastructure” set up by the hackers.",
      "This NSA summary judgment is sharply at odds with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denial last week that Russia had interfered in foreign elections: “We never engaged in that on a state level, and have no intention of doing so.” Putin, who had previously issued blanket denials that any such Russian meddling occurred, for the first time floated the possibility that freelance Russian hackers with “patriotic leanings” may have been responsible.",
      "It states unequivocally in its summary statement that it was Russian military intelligence, specifically the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, that conducted the cyber attacks described in the document:\n\nThe NSA analysis does not draw conclusions about whether the interference had any effect on the election’s outcome and concedes that much remains unknown about the extent of the hackers’ accomplishments.",
      "“It appears to be user errors at different points in the process, between the setup of the computers and the poll workers using them.”\n\nAll of this taken together ratchets up the stakes of the ongoing investigations into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives, which promises to soak up more national attention this week as fired FBI Director James Comey appears before Congress to testify.",
      "“The problem we have is that voting security doesn’t matter until something happens, and then after something happens, there’s a group of people who don’t want the security, because whatever happened, happened in their favor,” said Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert at Harvard’s Berkman Center who has written frequently about the security vulnerabilities of U.S. election systems.",
      "Vendors like VR are also particularly sensitive, according to Norden, because local election offices “are often unlikely to have many or even any IT staff,” meaning “a vendor like this will also provide most of the IT assistance, including the work related to programming and cyber security”—not the kind of people you want unwittingly compromised by a hostile nation state.",
      "“You could even do that preferentially in areas for voters that are likely to vote for a certain candidate and thereby have a partisan effect.”\n\nUsing this method to target a U.S. presidential election, the Russian approach faces a challenge in the decentralized federal election system, where processes differ not merely state to state but often county to county.",
      "According to Alex Halderman, director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society and an electronic voting expert, one of the main concerns in the scenario described by the NSA document is the likelihood that the officials setting up the electronic poll books are the same people doing the pre-programming of the voting machines.",
      "The NSA notes in its report that it is “unknown whether the aforementioned spear-phishing deployment successfully compromised all the intended victims, and what potential data from the victim could have been exfiltrated.”\n\nVR Systems declined to respond to a request for comment on the specific hacking operation outlined in the NSA document.",
      "In one, Russian military hackers created an email account pretending to be another U.S. election company, referred to in the document as U.S. company 2, from which they sent fake test emails offering “election-related products and services.” The agency was unable to determine whether there was any targeting using this account.",
      "“It is unknown,” the NSA notes, “whether the aforementioned spear-phishing deployment successfully compromised the intended victims, and what potential data could have been accessed by the cyber actor.”\n\nThe FBI would not comment about whether it is pursuing a criminal investigation into the cyber attack on VR Systems.",
      "Graphic: NSA\n\nThe Spear-Phishing Attack\n\nAs described by the classified NSA report, the Russian plan was simple: pose as an e-voting vendor and trick local government employees into opening Microsoft Word documents invisibly tainted with potent malware that could give hackers full control over the infected computers.",
      "It is unclear what the effort achieved, but the NSA assessed that the Russians appeared intent on “mimicking a legitimate absentee ballot-related service provider.” The report does not indicate why the Russians targeted the tiny Pacific islands, a U.S. territory with no electoral votes to contribute to the election.",
      "The top-secret National Security Agency document, which was provided anonymously to The Intercept and independently authenticated, analyzes intelligence very recently acquired by the agency about a months-long Russian intelligence cyber effort against elements of the U.S. election and voting infrastructure.",
      "Russian military intelligence executed a cyberattack on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and sent spear-phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials just days before last November’s presidential election, according to a highly classified intelligence report obtained by The Intercept.",
      "Any potential risks or vulnerabilities are being monitored, and this agency works with the Department of Homeland Security and the N.C. Department of Information Technology to help mitigate any potential risks,” said Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the North Carolina board of elections.",
      "“If you look at the last few elections, 2000 was decided in Florida, 2004 in Ohio, the most recent election in a couple counties in Michigan and Pennsylvania, so deciding exactly where to hack is really hard to know.”\n\nBut the system’s decentralization is also a vulnerability.",
      "To the extent the elections are vulnerable to hacking, we risk the legitimacy of the voting process, even if there is no actual hacking at the time.”\n\nThroughout history, the transfer of power has been the moment of greatest weakness for societies, leading to untold bloodshed.",
      "An attempt to directly break into or alter the actual voting machines would be more conspicuous and considerably riskier than compromising an adjacent, less visible part of the voting system, like voter registration databases, in the hope that one is networked to the other.",
      "“Once you get a beachhead, then you try to figure out how to go elsewhere.”\n\nAll of this means that it is critical to understand just how integral VR Systems is to our election system, and what exactly the implications of this breach are for the integrity of the result.",
      "“Once you do that, you can cause the voting machine to create fraudulent counts.”\n\nAccording to Schneier, a major prize in breaching VR Systems would be the ability to gather enough information to effectively execute spoof attacks against election officials themselves.",
      "Sure enough, VR Systems advertises the fact that its EViD computer polling station equipment line is connected to the internet, and that on Election Day “a voter’s voting history is transmitted immediately to the county database” on a continuous basis.",
      "“I would worry about whether an attacker who could compromise the poll book vendor might be able to use software updates that the vendor distributes to also infect the election management system that programs the voting machines themselves,” he added.",
      "“So in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn’t happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn’t.",
      "If collusion can ultimately be demonstrated — a big if at this point — then the assistance on Russia’s part went beyond allegedly hacking email to serve a propaganda campaign, and bled into an attack on U.S. election infrastructure itself.",
      "Although the document does not directly identify the company in question, it contains references to a product made by VR Systems, a Florida-based vendor of electronic voting services and equipment whose products are used in eight states.",
      "One U.S. intelligence official conceded that the Russian operation outlined by the NSA — targeting voter registration software — could potentially have disrupted voting in the locations where VR Systems’ products were being used.",
      "Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate actors … executed cyber espionage operations against a named U.S. company in August 2016, evidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions.",
      "These particular weaponized files used PowerShell, a Microsoft scripting language designed for system administrators and installed by default on Windows computers, allowing vast control over a system’s settings and functions.",
      "Pamela Smith, president of election integrity watchdog Verified Voting, agreed that even if VR Systems doesn’t facilitate the actual casting of votes, it could make an alluring target for anyone hoping to disrupt the vote.",
      "In a third Russian operation, the same group of hackers sent test emails to addresses at the American Samoa Election Office, presumably to determine whether those accounts existed before launching another phishing attack.",
      "The actual voting machines aren’t going to be networked to something like VR Systems’ EViD, but they do receive manual updates and configuration from people at the local or state level who could be responsible for both.",
      "Companies like VR are “very important” because “a functioning registration system is central to American elections,” explained Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.",
      "Christian Hilland, a spokesperson for the FEC, told The Intercept that “the Federal Election Commission does not have jurisdiction over voting matters as well as software and hardware in connection with casting votes.",
      "VR Systems doesn’t sell the actual touchscreen machines used to cast a vote, but rather the software and devices that verify and catalogue who’s permitted to vote when they show up on Election Day or for early voting.",
      "Overall, the method is one of “medium sophistication,” Williams said, one that “practically any hacker can pull off.”\n\nThe NSA, however, is uncertain about the results of the attack, according to the report.",
      "“I’ll take credentials most days over malware,” he said, since an employee’s login information can be used to penetrate “corporate VPNs, email, or cloud services,” allowing access to internal corporate data.",
      "Jake Williams, founder of computer security firm Rendition Infosec and formerly of the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations hacking team, said stolen logins can be even more dangerous than an infected computer.",
      "The registration system malfunctioned at a number of polling locations, causing chaos and long lines, which triggered election officials to switch to paper ballots and extend voting later into the evening.",
      "“What I was concerned about in particular was making sure [the DNC hack] wasn’t compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting, affect the actual election process itself,” Obama said.",
      "Whatever the investigation into the Trump campaign concludes, however, it pales in comparison to the threat posed to the legitimacy of U.S. elections if the infrastructure itself can’t be secured.",
      "The report adds significant new detail to the picture that emerged from the unclassified intelligence assessment about Russian election meddling released by the Obama administration in January.",
      "While the document provides a rare window into the NSA’s understanding of the mechanics of Russian hacking, it does not show the underlying “raw” intelligence on which the analysis is based.",
      "“It’s not just that [an election] has to be fair, it has to be demonstrably fair, so that the loser says, ‘Yep, I lost fair and square.’ If you can’t do that, you’re screwed,” said Schneier.",
      "Attached to the secret NSA report is an overview chart detailing the Russian government’s spear-phishing operation, apparently missing a second page that was not provided to The Intercept.",
      "Phishing, as the name implies, doesn’t require everyone to take the bait in order to be a success — though Williams stressed that hackers “never want just one” set of stolen credentials.",
      "The spear-phishing email contained a link directing the employees to a malicious, faux-Google website that would request their login credentials and then hand them over to the hackers.",
      "Chief Operating Officer Ben Martin replied by email to The Intercept’s request for comment with the following statement:\n\nPhishing and spear-phishing are not uncommon in our industry.",
      "While malicious emails targeting three of the potential victims were rejected by an email server, at least one of the employee accounts was likely compromised, the agency concluded.",
      "Although the NSA report indicates that VR Systems was targeted only with login-stealing trickery, rather than computer-controlling malware, this isn’t necessarily a reassuring sign.",
      "Some of the company’s devices are advertised as having wireless internet and Bluetooth connectivity, which could have provided an ideal staging point for further malicious actions.",
      "So on August 24, 2016, the Russian hackers sent spoofed emails purporting to be from Google to employees of an unnamed U.S. election software company, according to the NSA report.",
      "A U.S. intelligence officer who declined to be identified cautioned against drawing too big a conclusion from the document because a single analysis is not necessarily definitive.",
      "The January assessment presented the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusions but omitted many specifics, citing concerns about disclosing sensitive sources and methods.",
      "… The actors likely used data obtained from that operation to … launch a voter registration-themed spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations.",
      "However, the report raises the possibility that Russian hacking may have breached at least some elements of the voting system, with disconcertingly uncertain results.",
      "According to its website, VR Systems has contracts in eight states: California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.",
      "The NSA conclusion “demonstrates that countries are looking at specific tactics for election manipulation, and we need to be vigilant in defense,” said Schneier.",
      "“The N.C. State Board of Elections did not experience any suspicious activity during the 2016 election outside of what this agency experiences at other times.",
      "At a December press conference, President Obama said that he told Russian President Vladimir Putin in September not to hack the U.S. election infrastructure.",
      "We regularly participate in cyber alliances with state officials and members of the law enforcement community in an effort to address these types of threats.",
      "But in order to dupe the local officials, the hackers needed access to an election software vendor’s internal systems to put together a convincing disguise.",
      "But a more worrying prospect, according to Graff, is that hackers would target a company like VR Systems to get closer to the actual tabulation of the vote.",
      "“Usually at the county level there’s going to be some company that does the pre-election programming of the voting machines,” Halderman told The Intercept.",
      "“That makes it a very hard security problem, unlike your bank account.”\n\nSchneier said the attack, as described by the NSA, is standard hacking procedure.",
      "“Hacking an election is hard, not because of technology — that’s surprisingly easy — but it’s hard to know what’s going to be effective,” said Schneier.",
      "If there were a central U.S. election authority, it might have launched an investigation into what happened in Durham, North Carolina, on Election Day.",
      "According to Williams, if this type of attack were successful, the perpetrator would possess “unlimited” capacity for siphoning away items of interest.",
      "Photo: Ty Wright/Getty Images\n\nAn Alluring Target\n\nGetting attention and a budget commitment to election security requires solving a political riddle.",
      "The Intercept agreed to some of the redaction requests after determining that the disclosure of that material was not clearly in the public interest.",
      "But you needed a commitment of budget and attention.”\n\nThe NSA document briefly describes two other election-related Russian hacking operations.",
      "The report, dated May 5, 2017, is the most detailed U.S. government account of Russian interference in the election that has yet come to light.",
      "“There was some investigation there, essentially no evidence came out of it indicating there was any problem with the product,” he said.",
      "“The fact that this is occurring in October is troubling,” said one senior law enforcement official with significant cyber expertise.",
      "Durham’s voter rolls were run by VR Systems — the same firm that was compromised by the Russian hack, according to the NSA document.",
      "“If someone has access to a state voter database, they can take malicious action by modifying or removing information,” she said.",
      "A computer attack can thus spread quickly and invisibly through networked components of a system like germs through a handshake.",
      "EAC also accredits testing laboratories and certifies voting systems,” but it is a backwater commission with no real authority.",
      "And in fact we did not see further tampering of the election process.”\n\nYet the NSA has now found that the tampering continued.",
      "The report indicates that Russian hacking may have penetrated further into U.S. voting systems than was previously understood.",
      "You may want to check with the Election Assistance Commission.”\n\nChecking with the EAC is also less than confidence inspiring.",
      "George McCue, deputy director of the Durham County board of elections, also said that VR Systems’ software was not the issue.",
      "The EAC notes online that it “is charged with serving as a national clearinghouse of information on election administration.",
      "There is no strong central government oversight of the election process or the acquisition of voting hardware or software.",
      "Likewise, voter registration, maintenance of voter rolls, and vote counting lack any effective national oversight.",
      "Coming with the imprimatur of the election board’s main contractor, a fake email looks that much more authentic.",
      "Officials requested that we not publish or report on the top secret document and declined to comment on it.",
      "The risk is particularly heightened given how common it is to use the same password for multiple services.",
      "And a compromised election poll book system can do more than cause chaos on Election Day, said Halderman.",
      "And meanwhile, the Electoral College makes it difficult to predict where efforts should be concentrated.",
      "The commission was created in 2002 as the congressional reaction to the vote-counting debacle of 2000.",
      "When informed that we intended to go ahead with this story, the NSA requested a number of redactions.",
      "The NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were both contacted for this article.",
      "The NSA report, on the contrary, displays no doubt that the cyber assault was carried out by the GRU.",

      "Image: NSA\n\nIn any event, the hackers apparently got what they needed.",
      "Local officials said that a hack was not the cause of the disruption.",
      "The NSA identified seven “potential victims” at the company.",
      "A voter casts her ballot on Nov. 8, 2016 in Ohio.",
      "This was not hard to defend against.",

    "sentences": [
      "“All of these accusations are just complete garbage,” Page said about attacks on him by top officials in the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and unnamed intelligence officials, who have suggested that on a July trip to Moscow, Page met with “highly-sanctioned individuals” and perhaps even discussed an unholy alliance between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.",
      "“Instead of allowing the staff of the FBI to focus the nation’s limited resources on real threats, these desperate and unfounded calls for my investigation as a private citizen to advance political interests based on nothing more than preposterous mainstream media reports is a true disgrace.”\n\nIn the letter, Page also disclosed that he has sold his stake in the Russian energy giant Gazprom, at a loss.",
      "“And I also will say, if he’s doing that, he’s certainly not doing it with the permission or knowledge of the campaign, the activities that you described.”\n\nOther Trump campaign sources told me that Page was never really part of Trump’s inner circle, although he was an early member of the team who was working with Sam Clovis, one of Trump’s first campaign policy advisers.",
      "Last Friday, however, in a statement terming the Yahoo report “chilling,” the Clinton campaign doubled down on Reid’s call for a full investigation of suspected meetings between “Trump’s foreign policy adviser Carter Page and members of Putin’s inner circle.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump campaign has been distancing itself from Page.",
      "Citing “a well-placed Western intelligence source,” Yahoo news last week reported that the U.S. government had received intelligence reports that Page met with Igor Sechin, a friend of Vladimir Putin who runs Russian oil giant Rosneft, and Igor Diveykin, a high–ranking Russian intelligence official.",
      "The article floated accusations that Page had conducted “talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president.” Various other reports have alleged Page met with Sergei Ivanov, who until recently was the chief of Putin’s presidential administration.",
      "“It’s completely false and inconceivable that someone would even accuse me of that.”\n\nPage said that as part of the school’s graduation program, he did briefly meet and shake hands with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, who was also a speaker at the graduation event.",
      "Page’s investments in Gazprom, a company he has performed consulting work for in the past, have often been mentioned as evidence of a conflict of interest for the Trump campaign because Gazprom is a Putin-friendly entity that operates in collusion with the Russian government.",
      "Without naming Page, Reid said the FBI should investigate his meetings as part of the larger look into whether the Trump campaign was conspiring with the Russian government to tamper with the U.S. presidential election.",
      "In its zeal to fuel the Trump-Putin connection story, the Clinton campaign and Reid have gone beyond the facts to attack Page, and the Trump campaign apparently decided to throw him under the bus when the heat rose.",
      "(Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press)\n\nThe foreign policy adviser at the center of the storm over accusations that the Donald Trump campaign has secret ties to the Russian government has decided to publicly fight back.",
      "“I have not spoken with him at all, in fact, meaning he’s not part of our national security or foreign policy briefings that we do now at all, certainly not since I have become campaign manager,” she said.",
      "Although Page was one of Trump’s originally announced foreign policy advisers, campaign manager KellyAnne Conway told CNN on Sunday that Page is not really involved at with the campaign at this point.",
      "Last month, Reid wrote to FBI Director James B. Comey asking him to initiate an investigation into Page’s Moscow visit, where Page gave a speech at the graduation ceremony of the New Economic School.",
      "He’s a relatively unknown, mid-level oil industry consultant who has business ties to Russia and happens to believe that U.S. policy in Russia, including economic sanctions, should be reexamined.",
      "It’s so ridiculous I want to have it behind us.”\n\nReid’s letter came after senior intelligence officials briefed him about Russian hacking of U.S. political organizations and election systems.",
      "“For the record, I have not met this year with any sanctioned official in Russia despite the fact that there are no restrictions on U.S. persons speaking with such individuals,” he wrote.",
      "During the briefing, intelligence officials told Reid they were looking into Page’s meetings during his Moscow visit, according to congressional sources familiar with the conversation.",
      "He also said he made that clear to senior Trump campaign staff at the time, who he said approved his trip in advance with the understanding no campaign issues would be discussed.",
      "After months of not commenting and with the realization that he is now on his own, Page said he decided he has no choice but fight back against the accusations publicly.",
      "This morning, he sent a letter (PDF) to Comey asking him to swiftly dispose of the investigation into his meetings in Moscow, if such an investigation even exists.",
      "In his speech and in his personal interactions, Page said he made clear that he was acting in his personal capacity and not as a member of the Trump campaign.",
      "“All the ones that are mentioned in the various articles, I didn’t meet with any of those guys,” Page told me in his first public comments on the accusations.",
      "At Monday’s debate, Clinton should challenge Trump on this topic, while Trump should be more forthright about his potential conflicts of interest with Russia.",
      "There’s been no evidence presented to Congress about who Page met with, and Page said he has not been contacted by any government agency so far.",
      "In a long interview, Carter Page also told me he is taking a leave of absence from his work with the Trump campaign due to the controversy.",
      "Nonetheless, calling the accusations a “distraction,” Page told me he’s decided to take a leave of absence from working with the campaign.",
      "But the likelihood that Page is the center of a Kremlin-Trump conspiracy to undermine the U.S. democratic system is extremely low.",
      "Page has never met with Trump one on one and hasn’t been deeply involved in Trump foreign policy speeches or events, they said.",
      "Page is simply the latest Trump staffer to get chewed up and spit out by the sheer ugliness of this election cycle.",
      "“There’s so little time between now and the election, this is in the best interests of the candidate.",

      "Benenson responded with a few lines for Clinton to say about the foundation’s “life-saving work around the world.”\n\n“The notion that that anyone donating to the foundation was going to influence me in my job is absurd,” Benenson suggested Clinton say, to which Margolis suggested, adding “and never happened.”\n\nOf the rapid-response website, Sullivan wrote, “John [Podesta] and I discussed yesterday and think it is important that supporters and press know that we will deal aggressively with unfair attacks, but our real focus and hers is her proactive vision.",
      "Podesta tweeted on Friday evening that he did not “have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.”\n\nClinton spokesman Glen Caplin said in an email that, “Earlier today the U.S. government removed any reasonable doubt that the Kremlin has weaponized WikiLeaks to meddle in our election and benefit Donald Trump’s candidacy.”\n\nHe added, “We are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange who has made no secret of his desire to damage Hillary Clinton.",

      "I'm also the worst person to generate jokes....”\n\nThen Jim Margolis revealed a suggestion from Bill Clinton himself: “Wishing after hour 8 that Bernie would come through the door with his ‘damn email’ line.” But Benenson killed the line:\n\n“It’s a joke that would work and room would love it,” he said.",
      "Outside comms adviser Mandy Grunwald’s take: \"Very little in this speech that HRC wouldn't say….”\n\n7) Bernie oppo\n\nIn October 2015, just as Sanders' campaign was starting to pick up steam, Tony Carrk emailed colleagues a list of potential points to use against the Vermont senator.",
      "“With today’s WikiLeaks revelations we are finding out who Hillary Clinton really is, and it’s not hard to see why she fought so hard to keep her transcripts of speeches to Wall Street banks paying her millions of dollars secret,” said RNC Chairman Reince Preibus in a statement.",
      "The late-Friday release came almost immediately after a devastating tape emerged of Donald Trump in 2005 talking about how being “a star” entitled him to make aggressive sexual advances on women, fueling speculation that WikiLeaks is trying to tip the balance of the election.",
      "“The biggest question for this group is if and how HRC engages on Clinton Cash this week and what are the ‘two lines’ she would deliver,” Jake Sullivan wrote on May 3 to 10 top aides, including Jennifer Palmieri, Robby Mook, Mandy Grunwald, Joel Benenson and Jim Margolis.",
      "\"My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere,” Clinton told a Brazilian bank in 2013.",
      "Whether it’s plotting the candidates’ response to an early attack on influence peddling at the Clinton Foundation or writing jokes for an Iowa dinner speech, ad hoc committees — often incorporating advice from Bill Clinton — are shown agonizing over wording and tone.",
      "Story Continued Below\n\nThe batch of emails — which Wikileaks promised is the first of many more to come — provided a glimpse into the inner workings of the campaign, and offered telling details about Clinton’s views on trade and the middle class.",
      "8) Sounding 'Pro-Keystone'\n\nIn the speech excerpts, Clinton-allied researchers flagged her positive remarks about the Keystone XL Pipeline and trade, made well before she came out against the pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.",
      "The Clinton campaign ended up using some of the potential attacks, like Sanders supporting the Commodities Futures Modernization Act, which blocked regulating credit default swaps, while also bashing repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.",
      "How can Bernie Sanders and many like-minded Democrats continue to support her candidacy in light of these revelations?”\n\nClinton spokesman Brian Fallon appeared to criticize the media for digging through the trove on Friday evening.",
      "“Do we have some D who can squarely at Gowdy and demand he release all his emails for that last two years so people can see for themselves how politically motivated his investigations are?” wondered Clinton pollster Joel Benenson.",
      "Seriously, doubt we'll say we ‘encouraged’ but assume we'll support if it goes that way.”\n\nThe decision by the Obama administration was ultimately delayed, which aides presumed was to kick it past the Oct. 19 Canadian elections.",
      "5) Joking about the Benghazi hearing\n\nOn Oct. 24, 2015, the Clinton team debated how sharp of a dig Clinton should take at Rep. Trey Gowdy after her marathon appearance before his committee investigating the Benghazi attack.",
      "The email, with the subject line \"PLS REVIEW: Sanders Hits\" featured paragraphs of potential lines of attack against Sanders on labor and the environment, a 1994 crime bill, gun control, gay marriage, and the environment.",
      "3) Challenging Trey Gowdy\n\nIn March 2015, the Clinton campaign brass wondered whether they could recruit a friendly lawmaker to question House Benghazi investigators’ attempts to force Clinton to release her emails.",
      "In one of the most notable exchanges, Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk emails other members of the team on Jan. 25, 2016 to share excerpts of her paid speeches that could come back to bite the campaign.",
      "The first excerpt highlighted — with the header *CLINTON ADMITS SHE IS OUT OF TOUCH* — is from a Goldman Sachs-Black Rock event in 2014 in which Clinton discusses her distance from middle-class Americans.",
      "“I used to be obsessed with Donald Trump's hair, that was until I got to spend 11 hours staring at the top of Trey Gowdy's head,” Podesta suggested inserting into the speech.",
      "“However one caveat: I think it gives Bernie the credit for putting the email crap behind us instead of her --- she crushed the debate and she crushed at the committee.",
      "| Getty The most revealing Clinton campaign emails in WikiLeaks release The trove includes excerpts of Clinton's paid Wall Street speeches that were deemed problematic.",
      "“I just wanted to try to politically get ahead of this and where we are on the issue if this in fact happens,” wrote Nikki Budzinski, Clinton’s labor outreach director.",
      "“I flagged for Tina and Cheryl as well but it's a little troubling that Goldman Sachs was selected for the foundation event,” he wrote in an email to Podesta.",
      "Important that we do not appear beleaguered.”\n\nIn April, the team looked for ways to have reporters thoroughly debunk “Clinton Cash” before its release.",
      "George is cool as a cucumber, doesn't rush into it, but just destroys him slowly but surely over the course of the interview,” chimes in Nick Merrill.",
      "Beyond those excerpts, the emails affirm the campaign’s reputation for extreme caution, with an eagerness to proactively influence news coverage.",
      "“Amy Chozick from the NYT called us to indicate she had obtained a copy of the book on her own and intends to file a separate story tomorrow.",
      "As they discussed remarks she was set to deliver at the October Jefferson Jackson dinner the next night, Podesta had an idea for a joke.",
      "“The truth that has been exposed here is that the persona Hillary Clinton has adopted for her campaign is a complete and utter fraud.",
      "“The challenge is getting a member of congress to do it... because they think they will be called upon to make the same disclosure.",
      "“After i suggested this earlier in the week i talked to few people on the Hill,” wrote Jim Margolis, another Clinton strategist.",
      "Politically with the building trades, this would be a very dangerous posture.”\n\nPodesta replied, “Your [sic] in trouble, girl.",
      "When other estimates show trillions in new spending, he simply rejects them without offering his own estimate,\" Carrk wrote.",
      "“The trades are also hearing that HRC will put out a statement stating that she encouraged Obama to take this position.",
      "“I love the joke too but I think HRC should stay above the committee - and especially above personal insults about it.",
      "Clinton’s campaign would not confirm the authenticity of the emails — though it did not explicitly deny it either.",
      "“Striking how quickly concern abt Russia's masterminding of illegal hacks gave way to digging thru fruits of hack.",
      "We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn't believe in mortgages.",
      "“My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing.",
      "Then, adviser Jake Sullivan suggested that she may simply reveal her opposition in response to a question.",
      "Sen. Sanders has not told the American people how much his plans will cost and how he will pay for them.",
      "he lands nothing and everything is refuted (mostly based on our work),” wrote spokesman Jesse Ferguson.",
      "I pointed out that they don't believe private emails should be made public, so there is no hypocrisy.",
      "They considered Elijah Cummings but then suggested they choose an “HRC Warrior,” as Podesta put it.",
      "There is a lot of policy positions that we should give an extra scrub with Policy,” Carrk writes.",
      "The batch of emails provided a glimpse into the inner workings of the Hillary Clinton campaign.",
      "\"It's a scary new wrapping paper for trickle down,” said Jeffrey Liszt, an outside pollster.",
      "Mook suggested Nita Lowey, Steve Israel or “SJL” – apparently Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas.",
      "You people are a bunch of ninnies,” joked Clinton comms director Jennifer Palmieri.",
      "But there is nervousness just the same.”\n\n“Maybe a retiring senator like Mikulski.",
      "Under fire, they’re determined “not to look beleaguered,” as one aide put it.",
      "She's got every inch of the high ground right now,” Jake Sullivan replied.",
      "Mook suggested, an “Apprentice” joke, but noted, “I never saw the show.",

      "When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.",
      "That's why the slogan of my campaign is \"Stronger Together,\" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.",
      "So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton...\n\nCLINTON: ... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.",
      "I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.",
      "But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.",
      "That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.",
      "But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.",
      "Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.",
      "I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.",
      "TRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.",
      "We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.",

      "But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.",
      "Following a Washington Post report of Trump speaking in very lewd and sexually aggressive terms in a 2005 video, Trump has apologized but promised, in response, to raise Bill Clinton's indiscretions -- and Hillary Clinton's role in allegedly targeting his accusers -- at the debate.",

      "We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.",
      "I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.",
      "Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.",
      "You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.",
      "Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.",
      "And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.",
      "But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.",
      "The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.",
      "And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.",

      "(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.",
      "And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.",
      "When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.",

      "The assessment concluded with high confidence that the Kremlin ordered an extensive, multi-pronged propaganda effort “to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.”\n\nThat review did not attempt to assess what effect the Russian efforts had on the election, despite the fact that “Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards.” According to the Department of Homeland Security, the assessment reported reassuringly, “the types of systems we observed Russian actors targeting or compromising are not involved in vote tallying.”\n\nThe NSA has now learned, however, that Russian government hackers, part of a team with a “cyber espionage mandate specifically directed at U.S. and foreign elections,” focused on parts of the system directly connected to the voter registration process, including a private sector manufacturer of devices that maintain and verify the voter rolls.",
      "The NSA assessed that this phase of the spear-fishing operation was likely launched on either October 31 or November 1 and sent spear-fishing emails to 122 email addresses “associated with named local government organizations,” probably to officials “involved in the management of voter registration systems.” The emails contained Microsoft Word attachments purporting to be benign documentation for VR Systems’ EViD voter database product line, but which were in reality maliciously embedded with automated software commands that are triggered instantly and invisibly when the user opens the document.",
      "“This could affect whether someone has the ability to cast a regular ballot, or be required to cast a ‘provisional’ ballot — which would mean it has to be checked for their eligibility before it is included in the vote, and it may mean the voter has to jump through certain hoops such as proving their information to the election official before their eligibility is affirmed.”\n\nMark Graff, a digital security consultant and former chief cybersecurity officer at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, described such a hypothetical tactic as “effectively a denial of service attack” against would-be voters.",
      "“Once the user opens up that email [attachment],” Williams explained, “the attacker has all the same capabilities that the user does.” Vikram Thakur, a senior research manager at Symantec’s Security Response Team, told The Intercept that in cases like this the “quantity of exfiltrated data is only limited by the controls put in place by network administrators.” Data theft of this variety is typically encrypted, meaning anyone observing an infected network wouldn’t be able to see what exactly was being removed but should certainly be able to tell something was afoot, Williams added.",
      "If opened, the files “very likely” would have instructed the infected computer to begin downloading in the background a second package of malware from a remote server also controlled by the hackers, which the secret report says could have provided attackers with “persistent access” to the computer or the ability to “survey the victims for items of interest.” Essentially, the weaponized Word document quietly unlocks and opens a target’s back door, allowing virtually any cocktail of malware to be subsequently delivered automatically.",
      "Two months later, on October 27, they set up an “operational” Gmail account designed to appear as if it belonged to an employee at VR Systems, and used documents obtained from the previous operation to launch a second spear-phishing operation “targeting U.S. local government organizations.” These emails contained a Microsoft Word document that had been “trojanized” so that when it was opened it would send out a beacon to the “malicious infrastructure” set up by the hackers.",
      "This NSA summary judgment is sharply at odds with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denial last week that Russia had interfered in foreign elections: “We never engaged in that on a state level, and have no intention of doing so.” Putin, who had previously issued blanket denials that any such Russian meddling occurred, for the first time floated the possibility that freelance Russian hackers with “patriotic leanings” may have been responsible.",
      "It states unequivocally in its summary statement that it was Russian military intelligence, specifically the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, that conducted the cyber attacks described in the document:\n\nThe NSA analysis does not draw conclusions about whether the interference had any effect on the election’s outcome and concedes that much remains unknown about the extent of the hackers’ accomplishments.",
      "“It appears to be user errors at different points in the process, between the setup of the computers and the poll workers using them.”\n\nAll of this taken together ratchets up the stakes of the ongoing investigations into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives, which promises to soak up more national attention this week as fired FBI Director James Comey appears before Congress to testify.",
      "“The problem we have is that voting security doesn’t matter until something happens, and then after something happens, there’s a group of people who don’t want the security, because whatever happened, happened in their favor,” said Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert at Harvard’s Berkman Center who has written frequently about the security vulnerabilities of U.S. election systems.",
      "Vendors like VR are also particularly sensitive, according to Norden, because local election offices “are often unlikely to have many or even any IT staff,” meaning “a vendor like this will also provide most of the IT assistance, including the work related to programming and cyber security”—not the kind of people you want unwittingly compromised by a hostile nation state.",
      "“You could even do that preferentially in areas for voters that are likely to vote for a certain candidate and thereby have a partisan effect.”\n\nUsing this method to target a U.S. presidential election, the Russian approach faces a challenge in the decentralized federal election system, where processes differ not merely state to state but often county to county.",
      "According to Alex Halderman, director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society and an electronic voting expert, one of the main concerns in the scenario described by the NSA document is the likelihood that the officials setting up the electronic poll books are the same people doing the pre-programming of the voting machines.",
      "The NSA notes in its report that it is “unknown whether the aforementioned spear-phishing deployment successfully compromised all the intended victims, and what potential data from the victim could have been exfiltrated.”\n\nVR Systems declined to respond to a request for comment on the specific hacking operation outlined in the NSA document.",
      "In one, Russian military hackers created an email account pretending to be another U.S. election company, referred to in the document as U.S. company 2, from which they sent fake test emails offering “election-related products and services.” The agency was unable to determine whether there was any targeting using this account.",
      "“It is unknown,” the NSA notes, “whether the aforementioned spear-phishing deployment successfully compromised the intended victims, and what potential data could have been accessed by the cyber actor.”\n\nThe FBI would not comment about whether it is pursuing a criminal investigation into the cyber attack on VR Systems.",
      "Graphic: NSA\n\nThe Spear-Phishing Attack\n\nAs described by the classified NSA report, the Russian plan was simple: pose as an e-voting vendor and trick local government employees into opening Microsoft Word documents invisibly tainted with potent malware that could give hackers full control over the infected computers.",
      "It is unclear what the effort achieved, but the NSA assessed that the Russians appeared intent on “mimicking a legitimate absentee ballot-related service provider.” The report does not indicate why the Russians targeted the tiny Pacific islands, a U.S. territory with no electoral votes to contribute to the election.",
      "The top-secret National Security Agency document, which was provided anonymously to The Intercept and independently authenticated, analyzes intelligence very recently acquired by the agency about a months-long Russian intelligence cyber effort against elements of the U.S. election and voting infrastructure.",
      "Russian military intelligence executed a cyberattack on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and sent spear-phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials just days before last November’s presidential election, according to a highly classified intelligence report obtained by The Intercept.",
      "Any potential risks or vulnerabilities are being monitored, and this agency works with the Department of Homeland Security and the N.C. Department of Information Technology to help mitigate any potential risks,” said Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the North Carolina board of elections.",
      "“If you look at the last few elections, 2000 was decided in Florida, 2004 in Ohio, the most recent election in a couple counties in Michigan and Pennsylvania, so deciding exactly where to hack is really hard to know.”\n\nBut the system’s decentralization is also a vulnerability.",
      "To the extent the elections are vulnerable to hacking, we risk the legitimacy of the voting process, even if there is no actual hacking at the time.”\n\nThroughout history, the transfer of power has been the moment of greatest weakness for societies, leading to untold bloodshed.",
      "An attempt to directly break into or alter the actual voting machines would be more conspicuous and considerably riskier than compromising an adjacent, less visible part of the voting system, like voter registration databases, in the hope that one is networked to the other.",
      "“Once you get a beachhead, then you try to figure out how to go elsewhere.”\n\nAll of this means that it is critical to understand just how integral VR Systems is to our election system, and what exactly the implications of this breach are for the integrity of the result.",
      "“Once you do that, you can cause the voting machine to create fraudulent counts.”\n\nAccording to Schneier, a major prize in breaching VR Systems would be the ability to gather enough information to effectively execute spoof attacks against election officials themselves.",
      "Sure enough, VR Systems advertises the fact that its EViD computer polling station equipment line is connected to the internet, and that on Election Day “a voter’s voting history is transmitted immediately to the county database” on a continuous basis.",
      "“I would worry about whether an attacker who could compromise the poll book vendor might be able to use software updates that the vendor distributes to also infect the election management system that programs the voting machines themselves,” he added.",
      "“So in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn’t happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn’t.",
      "If collusion can ultimately be demonstrated — a big if at this point — then the assistance on Russia’s part went beyond allegedly hacking email to serve a propaganda campaign, and bled into an attack on U.S. election infrastructure itself.",
      "Although the document does not directly identify the company in question, it contains references to a product made by VR Systems, a Florida-based vendor of electronic voting services and equipment whose products are used in eight states.",
      "One U.S. intelligence official conceded that the Russian operation outlined by the NSA — targeting voter registration software — could potentially have disrupted voting in the locations where VR Systems’ products were being used.",
      "Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate actors … executed cyber espionage operations against a named U.S. company in August 2016, evidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions.",
      "These particular weaponized files used PowerShell, a Microsoft scripting language designed for system administrators and installed by default on Windows computers, allowing vast control over a system’s settings and functions.",
      "Pamela Smith, president of election integrity watchdog Verified Voting, agreed that even if VR Systems doesn’t facilitate the actual casting of votes, it could make an alluring target for anyone hoping to disrupt the vote.",
      "In a third Russian operation, the same group of hackers sent test emails to addresses at the American Samoa Election Office, presumably to determine whether those accounts existed before launching another phishing attack.",
      "The actual voting machines aren’t going to be networked to something like VR Systems’ EViD, but they do receive manual updates and configuration from people at the local or state level who could be responsible for both.",
      "Companies like VR are “very important” because “a functioning registration system is central to American elections,” explained Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.",
      "Christian Hilland, a spokesperson for the FEC, told The Intercept that “the Federal Election Commission does not have jurisdiction over voting matters as well as software and hardware in connection with casting votes.",
      "VR Systems doesn’t sell the actual touchscreen machines used to cast a vote, but rather the software and devices that verify and catalogue who’s permitted to vote when they show up on Election Day or for early voting.",
      "Overall, the method is one of “medium sophistication,” Williams said, one that “practically any hacker can pull off.”\n\nThe NSA, however, is uncertain about the results of the attack, according to the report.",
      "“I’ll take credentials most days over malware,” he said, since an employee’s login information can be used to penetrate “corporate VPNs, email, or cloud services,” allowing access to internal corporate data.",
      "Jake Williams, founder of computer security firm Rendition Infosec and formerly of the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations hacking team, said stolen logins can be even more dangerous than an infected computer.",
      "The registration system malfunctioned at a number of polling locations, causing chaos and long lines, which triggered election officials to switch to paper ballots and extend voting later into the evening.",
      "“What I was concerned about in particular was making sure [the DNC hack] wasn’t compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting, affect the actual election process itself,” Obama said.",
      "Whatever the investigation into the Trump campaign concludes, however, it pales in comparison to the threat posed to the legitimacy of U.S. elections if the infrastructure itself can’t be secured.",
      "The report adds significant new detail to the picture that emerged from the unclassified intelligence assessment about Russian election meddling released by the Obama administration in January.",
      "While the document provides a rare window into the NSA’s understanding of the mechanics of Russian hacking, it does not show the underlying “raw” intelligence on which the analysis is based.",
      "“It’s not just that [an election] has to be fair, it has to be demonstrably fair, so that the loser says, ‘Yep, I lost fair and square.’ If you can’t do that, you’re screwed,” said Schneier.",
      "Attached to the secret NSA report is an overview chart detailing the Russian government’s spear-phishing operation, apparently missing a second page that was not provided to The Intercept.",
      "Phishing, as the name implies, doesn’t require everyone to take the bait in order to be a success — though Williams stressed that hackers “never want just one” set of stolen credentials.",
      "The spear-phishing email contained a link directing the employees to a malicious, faux-Google website that would request their login credentials and then hand them over to the hackers.",
      "Chief Operating Officer Ben Martin replied by email to The Intercept’s request for comment with the following statement:\n\nPhishing and spear-phishing are not uncommon in our industry.",
      "While malicious emails targeting three of the potential victims were rejected by an email server, at least one of the employee accounts was likely compromised, the agency concluded.",
      "Although the NSA report indicates that VR Systems was targeted only with login-stealing trickery, rather than computer-controlling malware, this isn’t necessarily a reassuring sign.",
      "Some of the company’s devices are advertised as having wireless internet and Bluetooth connectivity, which could have provided an ideal staging point for further malicious actions.",
      "So on August 24, 2016, the Russian hackers sent spoofed emails purporting to be from Google to employees of an unnamed U.S. election software company, according to the NSA report.",
      "A U.S. intelligence officer who declined to be identified cautioned against drawing too big a conclusion from the document because a single analysis is not necessarily definitive.",
      "The January assessment presented the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusions but omitted many specifics, citing concerns about disclosing sensitive sources and methods.",
      "… The actors likely used data obtained from that operation to … launch a voter registration-themed spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations.",
      "However, the report raises the possibility that Russian hacking may have breached at least some elements of the voting system, with disconcertingly uncertain results.",
      "According to its website, VR Systems has contracts in eight states: California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.",
      "The NSA conclusion “demonstrates that countries are looking at specific tactics for election manipulation, and we need to be vigilant in defense,” said Schneier.",
      "“The N.C. State Board of Elections did not experience any suspicious activity during the 2016 election outside of what this agency experiences at other times.",
      "At a December press conference, President Obama said that he told Russian President Vladimir Putin in September not to hack the U.S. election infrastructure.",
      "We regularly participate in cyber alliances with state officials and members of the law enforcement community in an effort to address these types of threats.",
      "But in order to dupe the local officials, the hackers needed access to an election software vendor’s internal systems to put together a convincing disguise.",
      "But a more worrying prospect, according to Graff, is that hackers would target a company like VR Systems to get closer to the actual tabulation of the vote.",
      "“Usually at the county level there’s going to be some company that does the pre-election programming of the voting machines,” Halderman told The Intercept.",
      "“That makes it a very hard security problem, unlike your bank account.”\n\nSchneier said the attack, as described by the NSA, is standard hacking procedure.",
      "“Hacking an election is hard, not because of technology — that’s surprisingly easy — but it’s hard to know what’s going to be effective,” said Schneier.",
      "If there were a central U.S. election authority, it might have launched an investigation into what happened in Durham, North Carolina, on Election Day.",
      "According to Williams, if this type of attack were successful, the perpetrator would possess “unlimited” capacity for siphoning away items of interest.",
      "Photo: Ty Wright/Getty Images\n\nAn Alluring Target\n\nGetting attention and a budget commitment to election security requires solving a political riddle.",
      "The Intercept agreed to some of the redaction requests after determining that the disclosure of that material was not clearly in the public interest.",
      "But you needed a commitment of budget and attention.”\n\nThe NSA document briefly describes two other election-related Russian hacking operations.",
      "The report, dated May 5, 2017, is the most detailed U.S. government account of Russian interference in the election that has yet come to light.",
      "“There was some investigation there, essentially no evidence came out of it indicating there was any problem with the product,” he said.",
      "“The fact that this is occurring in October is troubling,” said one senior law enforcement official with significant cyber expertise.",
      "Durham’s voter rolls were run by VR Systems — the same firm that was compromised by the Russian hack, according to the NSA document.",
      "“If someone has access to a state voter database, they can take malicious action by modifying or removing information,” she said.",
      "A computer attack can thus spread quickly and invisibly through networked components of a system like germs through a handshake.",
      "EAC also accredits testing laboratories and certifies voting systems,” but it is a backwater commission with no real authority.",
      "And in fact we did not see further tampering of the election process.”\n\nYet the NSA has now found that the tampering continued.",
      "The report indicates that Russian hacking may have penetrated further into U.S. voting systems than was previously understood.",
      "You may want to check with the Election Assistance Commission.”\n\nChecking with the EAC is also less than confidence inspiring.",
      "George McCue, deputy director of the Durham County board of elections, also said that VR Systems’ software was not the issue.",
      "The EAC notes online that it “is charged with serving as a national clearinghouse of information on election administration.",
      "There is no strong central government oversight of the election process or the acquisition of voting hardware or software.",
      "Likewise, voter registration, maintenance of voter rolls, and vote counting lack any effective national oversight.",
      "Coming with the imprimatur of the election board’s main contractor, a fake email looks that much more authentic.",
      "Officials requested that we not publish or report on the top secret document and declined to comment on it.",
      "The risk is particularly heightened given how common it is to use the same password for multiple services.",
      "And a compromised election poll book system can do more than cause chaos on Election Day, said Halderman.",
      "And meanwhile, the Electoral College makes it difficult to predict where efforts should be concentrated.",
      "The commission was created in 2002 as the congressional reaction to the vote-counting debacle of 2000.",
      "When informed that we intended to go ahead with this story, the NSA requested a number of redactions.",
      "The NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were both contacted for this article.",
      "The NSA report, on the contrary, displays no doubt that the cyber assault was carried out by the GRU.",

      "“Credential-stealing, spear-phishing — this is how it’s done,” he said.",
      "“They’ll tear themselves apart if they’re convinced it’s not accurate.”",
      "Image: NSA\n\nIn any event, the hackers apparently got what they needed.",
      "Local officials said that a hack was not the cause of the disruption.",
      "The NSA identified seven “potential victims” at the company.",
      "A voter casts her ballot on Nov. 8, 2016 in Ohio.",
      "This was not hard to defend against.",

      "I don't know what's going to happen on any other issue, but when it came down to this immigration issue, his words gave me so much comfort that the speaker of the House is not going to allow the rug to be pulled from under the feet of all of these young people, 750,000 of them, who have sought this protection, who have applied for this law, who are now playing by the rules, who are working and living and studying, legally, contributing to this country.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Their argument was that this is something that the press already had, not just here in the United States but other places, that it would be -- they would be - they didn't use the word derelict, but it was their obligation to inform not only us but the president-elect that this was out there.",
      "PAMELA BROWN, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, our sources tell us, Brooke, that after that meeting with the intel chiefs last Friday, that James Comey, the director of the FBI, pulled Trump aside to brief him on the two-page synopsis of the allegations that were included in that 35-page memo about Trump and Russia, unsubstantiated allegations, I should say.",
      "That is important because any conversation about the sanctions between Flynn and the Russian ambassador could bring about accusations that Flynn was in violation of the Logan Act, which is a law that bars American citizens from negotiating with a foreign government that's in a dispute with the United States, which certainly was going on at the time.",
      "You have, you know, Speaker Ryan on immigration and just broadening out we've been watching these, you know, Senate confirmation hearings this week, right, these cabinet nominees this week on Iran and Russia and the border wall and their words stand in such stark contrast to the rhetoric we heard from Trump on the trail.",
      "The backdrop of this news, you have Vice President Joe Biden now confirming CNN's reporting that the intelligence community briefed both President-elect Trump and President Obama on those unsubstantiated claims that Russia may have compromising information on Mr. Trump, which is exactly what CNN has reported all along.",
      "But, of course, all of this is very important because one of the key questions coming out of this campaign was, did Donald Trump or any of his associates working for him or his organization, the campaign, have any contacts with Russian officials during the course of that campaign, in the context of that campaign.",
      "The transition says that conversation, which was first reported by \"The Washington Post\" we should point out, happened on December 28th, just one day before the Obama administration announced those new sanctions against Russia for its hacking operation in the 2016 election.",
      "Our sources tell us that that discussion was cordial and that the leaders felt it was important to brief the president-elect because essentially they didn't want it to come as a surprise to him if this memo were to surface later on when he was in the White House, Brooke.",
      "But what I heard from people like General Mattis, like General John Kelly, who said in that hearing that it's not a wall we need but a multilayered approach, that's been like the bastion of Donald Trump's entire campaign, build the wall, Mexico will pay for it.",
      "Let's start with the spy novel atmosphere that is continuing to descend upon Capitol Hill because we now know the president-elect's choice for national security adviser contacted the Russian ambassador to the United States multiple times late last month.",
      "When people get confidence in this country, that our border is secured, that our laws are being enforced, then I really believe the country, all people in the country, will be in a much better position to fix these thornier, bigger problems.",
      "But, of course, any time, you know, there's a report like this that talks about contacts between Trump, his people, and the Russians, it is going to generate a lot of attention here in Washington and, of course, all over the world, Brooke.",
      "NAVARRO: Look, I think we don't know yet, but I think that what you - what you've heard in a lot of these confirmation hearings is that the cabinet secretaries don't agree with the things that Donald Trump has been saying on the trail.",
      "BALDWIN: In the unspooling, you put it perfectly, we know that Vice President Joe Biden confirms that he and the president were briefed, Pamela, on the claims that the Russians had information, maybe some dirt, maybe, on Mr. Trump.",

      "There was a powerful exchange during CNN's town hall last night where this one woman, who is undocumented, stood there, her daughter by her side, and asked Speaker Ryan point-blank if he felt she should be deported.",
      "And so what we have to do is find a way to make sure that you can get right with the law, and we've got to do this in a good way so that the rug doesn't get pulled out from under you and your family gets separated.",
      "And if you had been hearing the campaign rhetoric that has happened on the Republican side for the last 18 months, if you'd been hearing Donald Trump on his promises and (INAUDIBLE) -\n\n\n\nBALDWIN: Deportation force.",
      "That he is a different type of president who rises to the occasion and who can actually improve unemployment, who can actually improve the economy, who can actually exert some leadership on foreign policy.",
      "We also know that Jim Comey, Gloria, you know, is facing this review, we talked about this 24 hours ago, over his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of the private e-mail server.",
      "[14:25:24] NAVARRO: I thought it was - was like there's this major disconnect between the Donald Trump we saw on the trail and the people he has appointed to actually make and implement his policies.",
      "And I think that any time you have an FBI director who finds himself in the middle of this storm, he has to sort of say, what - what should I do that's the best thing for the agency that I head.",
      "Then you have the sitting president just like a day later imposing the new sanctions against the Kremlin, which would be taboo with the - with the violation of the one president at a time rule.",
      "They only spoke about setting up a phone conversation between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that would take place after Inauguration Day, of course, next week, next Friday.",
      "BALDWIN: Coming up next, the Justice Department issued a report today on the Chicago Police Department, saying there was a pattern of excessive force and called the violence deeply troubling.",
      "The Trump transition team confirms, as you said, the incoming national\n\n\n\nsecurity adviser, Michael Flynn, did speak by phone with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, late last month.",
      "We've got to make sure that these laws are being enforced, that we are controlling our borders so violent criminals, repeat offenders, don't come in and do these kinds of horrific things.",
      "You know, hearing the Sean Spicer sound, saying it was just about, you know, texting over merry Christmas and setting up this phone call between, you know, Trump and Putin post-election.",
      "And if you think about it, if you have Trump and Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner there in the West Wing, you know, how much does it matter that these cabinet picks - what they're saying?",
      "Paul Ryan told our Jake Tapper yesterday that it would happen simultaneously, and that is prompting some concerns on Capitol Hill from Republicans who want to be more deliberative.",
      "But, at the same time, I don't think - and Gloria can weigh in on this - I don't think that they would want to leave the option up to Donald Trump to appoint another FBI director.",
      "NAVARRO: Well, you know what, Scottie - you know what, Scottie, don't tell me you're offended when I say (EXPLETIVE DELETED) but you're not offended when Donald Trump says it.",
      "Now, the current White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, Brooke, was just asked about this and Earnest told reporters he has, quote, \"zero insight\" into the conversation.",
      "Apparently it happened, actually, just right before the Obama administration announced that it was imposing new sanctions against the Kremlin for its election interference.",
      "Every single Republican is going to have to answer the question, what did you do the day you saw the tape of this man boasting about grabbing a woman's (EXPLETIVE DELETED)?",
      "But to do that, people need to have confidence that our laws are being followed and that we actually know who's coming and going and that we actually have a secure border.",

      "Now, incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the conversation came after the two men texted back and forth, wishing each other a merry Christmas.",
      "Also ahead, former President George W. Bush's daughters, both Jenna and Barbara, giving some heartfelt advice to the Obama girls on life after the White House.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nACOSTA: Now, Spicer went on to say that Flynn and Kislyak, and this really important, Brooke, only spoke about - and I - on December 28th.",
      "[14:10:26] But, of course, there is a new administration, and if he doesn't resign, he still has another boss, and that would be the next attorney general.",
      "But the big question, how will Republicans then, if they repeal, how to replace the plan since you have 20 million Americans who currently depend on this.",
      "And even when it comes to this first procedural vote, you know, there are still hesitations, Manu, among House Republicans over how they feel about this.",
      "Paul Ryan wants to add some provisions to replace the law in that repeal legislation, but there's only so much they can do under the rules of the Senate.",

      "The - when you look at how this is going to happen, first they are going to move through this budget process to try to repeal most of the law.",
      "They've been asking them in the confirmation hearings, which is, what really should the relationship be between the United States and Russia?",

      "You have this undocumented immigrant who stands in the audience and asks the speaker of the House here, Paul Ryan, do you want to deport me?",

      "No, Angelica, first of all, I can see that you love your daughter and you are a nice person who has a great future ahead of you.",
      "And at that point, expect a big fight internally, as well as with Democrats, not just on repealing the law, but replacing it.",
      "But to replace it, they have to move through the regular order of Congress, and that means they do need Democratic support.",
      "Does the incoming Trump administration have any kind of special relationship with Russia that is not currently known about?",

      "(Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)\n\nJared Kushner, the son-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump and one of his closest confidants, will join the White House as a senior adviser to the president, Trump announced Monday, while a lawyer assisting the family said that Kushner's wife, Ivanka Trump, will not immediately take on a formal role.",
      "Eisen said in an interview that “reasonable people may come to different views on this” but that he believes Trump's appointment of Kushner could prompt “some interesting litigation about whether [the 1967 law] applies or not.”\n\nSomeone who thinks they are negatively impacted by a Kushner decision could bring suit, Eisen said.",
      "[Trump’s son-in-law poised to resign as CEO of real estate company]\n\nSome ethics experts question whether a Kushner's appointment would violate the 1967 federal anti-nepotism statute, which came about after President John F. Kennedy named his brother as attorney general.",
      "But Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton, said she is confident that the anti-nepotism statute does not cover Trump's appointment of Kushner, though she acknowledged that some lawyers take the opposite view.",
      "But ethics experts have raised questions about whether Kushner's role in the new administration will run up against a federal anti-nepotism law and about how he will separate himself from his real estate business to avoid conflicts of interest.",
      "Ivanka Trump plans to resign from the Trump Organization and step away from her clothing company but will focus — at least in the short term — on settling the family into its new home in Washington, a lawyer working with the family said.",
      "Though Kushner’s company is focused primarily on development in New York and New Jersey, it has often relied on foreign investment, and its earnings could be influenced by the Trump administration's trade and foreign-relations policies.",
      "“This is not a close question,” Gorelick said, also citing subsequent law, passed in 1978, that she said allows the president to hire White House staffers “without regard” to federal personnel laws, including the anti-nepotism statute.",

      "I think as you hear the testimony of Rex Tillerson, of General Mattis, and Mike Pompeo, I think the American people will be greatly encouraged by the fact that the president-elect is assembling around him people of extraordinary background and capability who will bring their own experience and their own perspective to inform the president’s decisions.",
      "I think what the country--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me--\n\nMIKE PENCE: --should be encouraged by is whether it be Rex Tillerson as our secretary of state, Nikki Haley going to the United Nations, General Mattis, is that he is surrounding himself with a group of men and women that are going to bring the broadest range of experience, inform his decisions.",
      "And so especially it`s always a problem, but it`s a particularly potentially large problem for a president of the United States who has never run - has no government experience whatsoever and is dealing with - not in the (INAUDIBLE) that he`s been in the White House, the least experienced staff in this city of any presidency that we`ve ever seen.",
      "And I do hope that John Lewis will reconsider his statement but also will reconsider attending the inauguration, will join us so that we can come together to take on the intractable problems facing Americans, particularly too many families in our inner cities who are beset by unsafe streets, failing schools, and a lack of jobs and opportunities.",
      "Or does he give them an address that is more, I come not to bring peace but the sword, a message of - of really anti-Washington, anti-elite sentiment that says to the American people, people who voted for him, that he is going to be their champion and return power back to them away from the Washington elite that they so despise.",
      "You know, I - all this stuff about being an entrepreneur and listening - you know, you get a divided administration on an issue like Russia policy - and we now see a clear division between people close to Trump who want a much more (INAUDIBLE) with Russia and people close to Pence who - who seem to strongly resist that.",

      "MARCUS: And - and there`s other baggage, John, that isn`t necessarily his doing, but we were reminded of it this week, which is the feeling that many people have out there that FBI Director James Comey unfairly and inappropriately and effectively even whether - whatever his intention was, intervened in the election.",
      "DOMENECH: We learned in the early days of the Bush administration that - after the interaction with the - the Chinese spy plane incident, we learned that George W. Bush was listening more to the Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice school than we might have expected given some of his other choices going in.",
      "DOMENECH: But I think the real issue here is that with all of these different types of folks in this cabinet representing different viewpoints and having a lot of different backgrounds, we`re not going to really know who Donald Trump is listening to on each of these subjects until a moment of crisis.",
      "But the reality is, that some rules of physics are not repealed by Donald Trump being president, and those rules go back years in our - in this city in politics, which is that if you have a secretary of defense and a national security advisor who are at war, it is a problem for your foreign policy.",
      "ED O`KEEFE, “THE WASHINGTON POST”: Well, you know, I think it`s important despite what the vice president-elect said about 30 - out of 50 states and a landslide to remember, if you look at polling that was out this week, only 37 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the president-elect.",
      "I think they need to get to the bottom of the issues that were raised in this unsubstantiated, so far as we know, inaccurate dossier that was compiled about contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during what is now a confirmed Russian covert action against our political system.",
      "MIKE PENCE: Well, you know, if you listen carefully to that press conference this week, and I was standing just alongside of him at the time, that he said it’d be good if we had a better relationship with Russia--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: But does-- (OVERTALK)\n\nMIKE PENCE: --I hope it’s get better.",
      "I mean, you--\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: Well –\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Sometimes –\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: -- it can mean a lot of phone calls, for example, from the foreign minister to Tillerson saying, “Rex, you know, what is this guy doing?” And it means that Mattis and Tillerson have a really large assignment.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Well—so, I guess my question is how do you work, then, with this--\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: Well, I hope what he does is say to the new Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, “I expect you to thoroughly overhaul the entire community.”\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you this.",

      "As I look at this, and I`ve covered foreign policy going back to the `70s, I`m embarrassed to say, I have seen this movie before, divided administrations with sharply differing viewpoints on policy have occurred often, and they`re very difficult for presidents to manage.",
      "Look, I attended both of Barack Obama’s inaugurations, one as a congressman and one as a governor, because I believe inaugurations are a moment when we should come together around that individual who has been elected to be president of the United States of America.",
      "And I think what the team told me is there is such a tremendous amount of interest in this incoming administration that they’re giving some consideration to finding a larger venue on the 18 acres in the White House complex to accommodate the extraordinary interest.",
      "And I think a good example of that is someone like Rand Paul, who has been a out there vocally supporting Donald Trump`s commitment to pass a replacement for Obamacare very soon after repeal, but that`s the kind of aggressive step that Paul and Trump can agree on.",
      "If his first reaction is to think the intelligence agencies are trying to do him wrong and compares them to the Nazis, that does not suggest a relationship of trust--\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: Well, I don’t think there should be--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: -- that would be healthy.",
      "IGNATIUS: Well, it`s going to be harder for Trump - he - just assuming Trump really thinks, you know, I can be friends with Vladimir Putin and that`s good for the world, it`s going to be harder to do that in the environment that this hacking scandal has created.",

      "MIKE PENCE: Well, I think in the president-elect you have someone who is willing to approach this terrible relationship the United States has with Russia today with fresh eyes and to at least be open to a better relationship with Vladimir Putin and with Russia.",
      "MIKE PENCE: I talked to General Flynn about that conversation and actually was initiated on Christmas Day he had sent a text to the Russian ambassador to express not only Christmas wishes but sympathy for the loss of life in the airplane crash that took place.",
      "At the same time, there`s a camp of people who I would put in the sort of skeptical camp among the Republicans who feel like they`re going to be able to work with Donald Trump on a handful of issues, but then also have to balance against him on other accounts.",
      "If you look at what`s gone on up there kind of under the radar with all the focus on the administration in waiting, you`ve had attempts to undo an ethics office, you`ve had stiff penalties put in place on members who may try to act out on the House floor.",
      "But I think that Richard Burr, Senator Burr, my dear friend, saw the interest that we all have, and basically, seeing the interest of the American people, that we want to find out the intent of the Russians, and to what extent the Russians are involved.",
      "But I think that really, really eats at the craw (ph) of a lot of people who concerned about him becoming president, that he`s not necessarily trying to be the leader of all, he`s trying to perhaps just be the leader of those 30 or 50 states.",

      "MIKE PENCE: Well, I think that there frankly has just been an effort by many in the national media, present company excepted, since this election to essentially demean and question the legitimacy of this incoming administration.",
      "But what I can confirm, having spoken to him about it, is that those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions.",
      "And the peaceful transition of power that’ll take place this coming Friday on a platform where our president-elect will take the oath of office surrounded by four of the five living presidents is a testament to our democracy.",
      "The bottom line is, if we’re concerned about the Russians and we know the Russians want to be involved, Putin wants to be involved in altering our process, then he will succeed if he sees this bickering going back and forth.",
      "And the fact that a few news organizations, not this one, actually trafficked in a memo that was produced as opposition research and associated that with intelligence efforts I think could only be attributed to media bias.",
      "DICKERSON: John, what do you make of the drive the bus question I was trying to get at, which is Donald Trump has a set of views on Russia, on torture that seems at odds with the people who are going to head his cabinet?",

      "And so for someone of his stature not just in the civil rights movement but in voting rights to make a comment that he did not consider Donald Trump to be a legitimate president I think is deeply disappointing.",
      "That’s what the American people want to know, and it’s what my colleagues should know, so we know basically their true intent, and we cannot let them be involved in basically altering our political process.",
      "HEILEMANN: Given the - given the confusion about what Republicans want as a replacement for Obamacare, if you were going to do a substantially different healthcare reform law, it cannot be done immediately.",
      "And to hear John Lewis, a man that I served with, that I respect question the legitimacy of the election and to say that Donald Trump will not be a legitimate president is deeply disappointing to me.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Well, I mean--\n\nMIKE PENCE: But the president-elect is determined to re-engage the world, put America first, and see if we can make progress for the security and peace of the world.",

      "MIKE PENCE: Well, the great thing about being around Donald Trump is you never have any confusion about who’s driving the bus, and where the buck stops, and who will make the final decision.",
      "MIKE PENCE: Well, I think-- I think America is going to be more respected in the world the very moment that Donald Trump takes the oath of office as the 45th president of the United States.",
      "And the president-elect actually in a tweet late last night invited Congressman Lewis to work with us to bring more prosperity, better schools, more safety to our cities around the country.",
      "But I think the president-elect also made it clear this week, John, that while a better relationship with Russia would be a good thing, I think he’s realistic about the possibility of that.",
      "And so while we certainly respect the right of the Congress to provide oversight, to make inquiries where they deem them appropriate, this-- the American people spoke in this election.",
      "But then that opinion was changed, and the Intelligence Committee is now going to look into that issue and whether there were any connections with the Russians and the Trump campaign.",
      "I mean, and most like citizens -- we’re going to go through a period here of adjustment to the fact that we have the first truly entrepreneurial president we’ve seen in modern times.",

      "It`s - it`s not a question of whether sanctions were discussed, but whether these meetings that were essentially contemporaneous with the announcement of sanctions undercut them.",
      "And I think the interest of the team is to make sure that we accommodate the broadest number of people who are interested and media from around the country and around the world.",
      "He also faces another set of challenges, which is that normally the reason you get a honeymoon as president-elect and then as president is that you start with the clean slate.",
      "DAVID IGNATIUS, “WASHINGTON POST”: Well, I think first, it`s - it`s important that Vice President-elect Pence welcome that investigation, implicitly committed to support it.",

      "MIKE PENCE: Well, I think in the context of these confirmation hearings, the president-elect has made a point to talk to each of the various candidates for these positions.",
      "My question is: If the American people are listening to Mr. Trump and listening to those men and, more importantly, countries overseas are listening, who’s driving the bus?",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Senator, what do you think of Congressman John Lewis’ decision to not attend the inauguration, and some other of his colleagues making that same decision?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think they’ve got to decide what the top three to five things are, stay focused on them every morning as long as they can until they get them done.",
      "And it`s not necessarily what he`ll say in the inaugural address, because I assume he will rise to the occasion, I certainly hope so, but it`s how he behaves afterwards.",
      "And we’re going to show them they’re not going to change and not going to alter how we work and function as Congress, as a government, and the United States of America.",
      "For five years, Donald Trump questioned the legitimacy of Barack Obama, that he wasn’t born in America, he was really the chief advocate of this so-called birther idea.",
      "And we can do, John, quite a bit of open meetings there, in that Committee also, once we get to the classified status, and then we have to go into our closed meetings.",
      "The tone that - that Trump takes, the tone that he really has when he comes and speaks in front of the American people is going to send a message one way or the other.",
      "The other thing I think that`s important in those numbers, 34 percent believe he`d be a better leader than President Obama, also a pretty poor showing on that regard.",
      "What did you make about the disconnect between Donald - what Donald Trump has said on Russia and issues of water boarding and what we heard from his to top officials?",

      "And at some point if there is no check on this, or if there`s no attempt at cooperation, I - you could see some real trouble for Republicans stewardship of Congress.",
      "Another question - word for that that might be less polite might be “incoherent.” We need to -\n\nHEILEMANN: Or “improvisational.”\n\nDICKERSON: Well -\n\nMARCUS: Or both.",
      "DOMENECH: You know the thing that`s interesting about the mood on Capitol Hill among Republicans rights now is that there - there are a couple of different classes.",
      "Is it sounding a note of - of optimism about an ability to work across partisan lines, to be a nontraditional president in a way that benefits the American people?",
      "I mean, what-- (OVERTALK) --what’s so encouraging to be around Donald Trump and to literally be sitting side by side with him during the course of this transition.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: But there’s a distinction between that feeling about the press and legitimate inquiry, as you say, that the Senate Intelligence Committee is doing.",
      "But I can-- (OVERTALK)\n\nJOHN DICKERSON:--have Mattis and Tillerson saying, “Confront Russia.” Donald Trump doesn’t sound like a guy who wants to confront Russia.",
      "I would - you know, it`s been two weeks of the new Congress, and say that, you know, on the Senate side there are some genuine attempts at cooperation underway.",
      "Those are - whatever you think of them on the merits, huge political challenges for a new president to come in with that much baggage attached to their wagon.",
      "He should think about a previous president, the incumbent president`s grandiose promises about, if you like your healthcare you can keep it -\n\nHEILEMANN: Yes.",
      "Just to button up one question, did any advisor or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the election?",
      "(OVERTALK)\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: And if you get rid of the press briefing room, you can create more room for the daily press guys who have to be there every day.",
      "But I think that what - what is clear about this Obamacare incident is that Donald Trump is going to be demanding certain things of Republicans in Congress.",
      "MIKE PENCE: --General Mattis, and Senator Coats, and Mike Pompeo, we’re coming at this--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: But--\n\nMIKE PENCE: --with realistic expectations.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Congressman John Lewis, who you served with, Democrat, told on Meet the Press that he did not consider Donald Trump a legitimate president.",
      "That would be a confrontation that people-- certainly Mattis and Tillerson would-- in the context of what they said, it sounds like that’s what they want.",
      "MIKE PENCE: Well--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: I guess the point is if Donald Trump’s driving the bus, shouldn’t his secretary of state know where the bus is going?",
      "I think the comments made by John Lewis this weekend had as much to do with the presidency as it does with the tinder box nature of the House right now.",
      "Also, announcing that you`re going to have an immediate replacement when you have a 60 vote threshold in the Senate, that`s also going to be very hard.",
      "DICKERSON: And - and if we have this kind of conflict that we`ve been talking about, Democrats are going to pay a price for working with Donald Trump.",
      "BEN DOMENECH, “THE FEDERALIST”: I think it really says how much more important this inaugural address is going to be compared to perhaps other ones.",

      "JOHN DICKERSON: Last week before that intelligence briefing, the president-elect said he felt like all these questions were part of a witch hunt.",
      "Thanks so much for being with us, and we’ll be back in just a moment with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an advisor to the Trump transition.",
      "I think they’ll find what the publicly released intelligence report showed before, is that there’s no evidence of any impact on voting machines.",
      "And the fact is, the rest of the planet’s going to have to -- for better or worse -- learn how to cope with a president who’s very complicated.",
      "And then - and then you have this fight over, you know, art hanging on the walls of the Capitol and whether or not some of it was appropriate.",

      "He said not only will it be repealed and replaced, he said simultaneously, that was his words, but it will be much better and cost less.",
      "And talk of that, sources within the intelligence community that have been attributed with sharing that information, public officials.",
      "MIKE PENCE: I think Rex Tillerson will have and has no confusion about who will be making the decisions in the Trump administration.",

      "DICKERSON: And then their hope who have to be that the man at the top has just a different view than the people who speak for him?",
      "Because the picture that Donald Trump put forward about his view of Russia seems quite different than the gentlemen you mentioned.",
      "MIKE PENCE: Well, I think the president-elect and I both welcome the Congress doing its oversight work in this and any other area.",
      "And ultimately-- (OVERTALK)\n\nMIKE PENCE:--the president will make the best decision in the best interests of the American people.",
      "They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.",
      "DICKERSON: You`ve also been writing about Michael Flynn, the incoming national security advisor, and contacts with the Russians.",
      "DICKERSON: What do you make of the fact that Chairman Burr at one point was saying he wasn`t going to investigate it and now is?",
      "You could hear that in the testimony that General Mattis gave, that Rex Tillerson gave, that Mike Pompeo the CIA nominee gave.",
      "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: And we’re back with former House speaker and Trump transition vice-chairman Newt Gingrich.",

      "It`s possible that this whole effort to hack our political system, to destabilize U.S. politics, is backfiring for Russia.",
      "1) The very top people who are political appointees I think absolutely betrayed and undermined the intelligence community.",

      "What’s the biggest obstacle -- when you have, when you want to do a lot of things very quickly-- that Donald Trump faces?",
      "NEWT GINGRICH: -- for a president to do is remember why they got up in the morning and what they’re trying to accomplish.",
      "The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has decided to investigate Russian meddling in the election.",
      "Donald Trump said it on election night, John, that he’s determined to be president of all of the people of this country.",

      "A lot of people who don`t have - may not have - may not question Trump`s legitimacy, but question what has gone on here.",
      "On the one hand, some intelligence officials say this is an unprecedented effort to try to influence the U.S. election.",

      "Yates said she began their meeting by laying out the press accounts and statements made by Vice President Mike Pence and other high-ranking White House officials about Flynn’s conduct “that we knew not to be the truth.”\n\nShe told McGahn how the DOJ acquired that information and walked through Flynn’s conduct \"in a fair amount of detail.”\n\nShe explained to McGahn the reasons why the DOJ was informing the White House of this -- Flynn’s conduct was “problematic in and of itself,” they believed Pence was entitled to know the information about Flynn he was spreading “wasn’t true,” and that the American people had been misled about Flynn’s actions.",
      "She stated bluntly in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee: “We felt like it was critical that we get this information to the White House in part because the vice president was unknowingly making false statements to the public and because we believed that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians.”\n\nShe said they had explored whether the decision to inform the White House “might impact that ongoing investigation” being conducted by the FBI, but that once Flynn had been interviewed, their concerns were mitigated.",
      "Yates stressed that one of the reasons why the DOJ decided to notify McGahn was because the Russians were aware of Flynn’s conduct, including that Flynn had misled Pence and that she had not accused Pence of “knowingly providing false information to the American people.”\n\n“This was a problem because not only did we believe that the Russians knew this, but that they likely had proof of this information,” Yates said during her testimony today.",
      "McGahn asked if he could look at the underlying evidence of Flynn’s conduct, and she said they would work with the FBI over the weekend and “get back with him on Monday morning.”\n\nJan. 30, 2017\n\nYates called McGahn “first thing Monday morning” to tell him he would be allowed to “come over and review the underlying evidence.”\n\nShe didn’t hear back from him until that afternoon.",
      "However, she said she doesn’t know whether McGahn or anyone from his office came to look at the material “because that was my last day with DOJ.”\n\nYates left her post with the DOJ that day because Trump fired her after she ordered the Justice Department not to defend Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order.",
      "When asked whether Flynn might have been compromised during the 18-day period he remained national security advisor, Yates said she doesn’t have an answer for that, but that she was “really concerned about the compromise here.”\n\n“That was the reason why we were encouraging them to act,” Yates said.",
      "Yates also said her decision to notify the White House counsel had been discussed “at great length.”\n\n“Certainly leading up to our notification on the 26th, it was a topic of a whole lot of discussion in DOJ and with other members of the intel community,” Yates said today during her testimony.",

      "Yates said she began their meeting by laying out the press accounts and statements made by Vice President Mike Pence and other high-ranking White House officials about Flynn’s conduct “that we knew not to be the truth.”\n\nShe told McGahn how the DOJ acquired that information and walked through Flynn’s conduct \"in a fair amount of detail.”\n\nShe explained to McGahn the reasons why the DOJ was informing the White House of this -- Flynn’s conduct was “problematic in and of itself,” they believed Pence was entitled to know the information about Flynn he was spreading “wasn’t true,” and that the American people had been misled about Flynn’s actions.",
      "She stated bluntly in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee: “We felt like it was critical that we get this information to the White House in part because the vice president was unknowingly making false statements to the public and because we believed that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians.”\n\nShe said they had explored whether the decision to inform the White House “might impact that ongoing investigation” being conducted by the FBI, but that once Flynn had been interviewed, their concerns were mitigated.",
      "Yates stressed that one of the reasons why the DOJ decided to notify McGahn was because the Russians were aware of Flynn’s conduct, including that Flynn had misled Pence and that she had not accused Pence of “knowingly providing false information to the American people.”\n\n“This was a problem because not only did we believe that the Russians knew this, but that they likely had proof of this information,” Yates said during her testimony today.",
      "McGahn asked if he could look at the underlying evidence of Flynn’s conduct, and she said they would work with the FBI over the weekend and “get back with him on Monday morning.”\n\nJan. 30, 2017\n\nYates called McGahn “first thing Monday morning” to tell him he would be allowed to “come over and review the underlying evidence.”\n\nShe didn’t hear back from him until that afternoon.",
      "However, she said she doesn’t know whether McGahn or anyone from his office came to look at the material “because that was my last day with DOJ.”\n\nYates left her post with the DOJ that day because Trump fired her after she ordered the Justice Department not to defend Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order.",
      "When asked whether Flynn might have been compromised during the 18-day period he remained national security advisor, Yates said she doesn’t have an answer for that, but that she was “really concerned about the compromise here.”\n\n“That was the reason why we were encouraging them to act,” Yates said.",
      "Yates also said her decision to notify the White House counsel had been discussed “at great length.”\n\n“Certainly leading up to our notification on the 26th, it was a topic of a whole lot of discussion in DOJ and with other members of the intel community,” Yates said today during her testimony.",

      "REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko The Ukrainian lawmaker who met with President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the businessman Felix Sater in New York last month to discuss a controversial peace plan for Ukraine \"got confirmation\" from Sater that his plan was delivered to the White House, he told Business Insider.",
      "But some Ukrainians have characterized Artemenko as a relatively marginal, if not virtually unknown, player, whose \"peace\" plan was probably not his own creation but that of Ukraine's pro-Russia Opposition Bloc formed after former President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in 2014.",
      "Controversy erupted earlier this month after The New York Times reported that Cohen said he had \"hand-delivered\" the plan in a sealed envelope to Michael Flynn before Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser over a separate Russia-related firestorm.",
      "Andrey Artemenko, a member of Ukraine's parliament who used to be part of the country's far-right Radical Party, said he met with Cohen and Sater at the Loews Regency New York on January 27 to discuss Artemenko's proposal for solving the Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
      "Strana.ua, a Ukrainian news site, recently reported that Artemenko told them in an interview that he began discussing his peace plan with Cohen and Sater last year, \"at the time of the primaries, when no one believed that Trump would even be nominated.\"",
      "But Cohen quickly walked back his initial story, telling The Washington Post hours after the Times story was published that he hadn't delivered the plan to Flynn or discussed it with anyone in the White House.",
      "But he acknowledged in a later text that he met with Artemenko in New York for \"under 10 minutes\" to discuss a plan Artemenko said \"was acknowledged by Russian authorities that would create world peace.\"",
      "Artemenko said he modeled his plan to lease Crimea to Russia off China's lease of Hong Kong to Britain for 99 years in 1898 and the US's contentious \"lease\" of the Panama Canal from Colombia in 1903.",
      "In court filings, however, Ukrainian prosecutors said Artemenko's proposal was an attempt to \"legitimize the temporary occupation\" of Crimea by Russia, which forcibly annexed the peninsula in 2014.",

      "The January 27 rendezvous was not the first time Artemenko, a self-proclaimed Trump supporter, made contact with the president's allies.",
      "He said he thought the government felt threatened by him \"because I'm alone and I have my own foreign allies, contacts, and supporters.\"",
      "Reuters/Francois Lenoir\n\nThe prosecutors also accused Artemenko of conspiring with Moscow to commit \"subversive acts against Ukraine.\"",

      "Yates said she began their meeting by laying out the press accounts and statements made by Vice President Mike Pence and other high-ranking White House officials about Flynn’s conduct “that we knew not to be the truth.”\n\nShe told McGahn how the DOJ acquired that information and walked through Flynn’s conduct \"in a fair amount of detail.”\n\nShe explained to McGahn the reasons why the DOJ was informing the White House of this -- Flynn’s conduct was “problematic in and of itself,” they believed Pence was entitled to know the information about Flynn he was spreading “wasn’t true,” and that the American people had been misled about Flynn’s actions.",
      "She stated bluntly in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee: “We felt like it was critical that we get this information to the White House in part because the vice president was unknowingly making false statements to the public and because we believed that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians.”\n\nShe said they had explored whether the decision to inform the White House “might impact that ongoing investigation” being conducted by the FBI, but that once Flynn had been interviewed, their concerns were mitigated.",
      "Yates stressed that one of the reasons why the DOJ decided to notify McGahn was because the Russians were aware of Flynn’s conduct, including that Flynn had misled Pence and that she had not accused Pence of “knowingly providing false information to the American people.”\n\n“This was a problem because not only did we believe that the Russians knew this, but that they likely had proof of this information,” Yates said during her testimony today.",

      "Yates also said her decision to notify the White House counsel had been discussed “at great length.”\n\n“Certainly leading up to our notification on the 26th, it was a topic of a whole lot of discussion in DOJ and with other members of the intel community,” Yates said today during her testimony.",

      "It is setup for optional SSL client authentication: if a client sends a valid client certificate (only implants can do that), the connection is forwarded to the 'Honeycomb' toolserver that communicates with the implant; if a valid certificate is missing (which is the case if someone tries to open the cover domain website by accident), the traffic is forwarded to a cover server that delivers an unsuspicious looking website.",
      "How the CIA dramatically increased proliferation risks\n\nIn what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of \"Vault 7\" — the CIA's weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems — the agency has little legal recourse.",
      "CIA 'hoarded' vulnerabilities (\"zero days\")\n\nIn the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks about the NSA, the U.S. technology industry secured a commitment from the Obama administration that the executive would disclose on an ongoing basis — rather than hoard — serious vulnerabilities, exploits, bugs or \"zero days\" to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers.",
      "\"Year Zero\" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of \"zero day\" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.",
      "This includes multiple local and remote weaponized \"zero days\", air gap jumping viruses such as \"Hammer Drill\" which infects software distributed on CD/DVDs, infectors for removable media such as USBs, systems to hide data in images or in covert disk areas ( \"Brutal Kangaroo\") and to keep its malware infestations going.",
      "Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the \"Year Zero\" disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed, disarmed and published.",
      "While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in \"Vault 7\" part one (“Year Zero”) already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks.",
      "The 'Case Officer' is also asked to specify the environment of the target like the type of computer, operating system used, Internet connectivity and installed anti-virus utilities (PSPs) as well as a list of file types to be exfiltrated like Office documents, audio, video, images or custom file types.",
      "Evading forensics and anti-virus\n\nA series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Nokia, Blackberry, Siemens and anti-virus companies attribute and defend against attacks.",
      "The instructions for incoming CIA hackers make Germany's counter-intelligence efforts appear inconsequential: \"Breeze through German Customs because you have your cover-for-action story down pat, and all they did was stamp your passport\"\n\nYour Cover Story (for this trip)\n\nQ: Why are you here?",
      "The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell's 1984, but \"Weeping Angel\", developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization.",
      "Analysis\n\nCIA malware targets iPhone, Android, smart TVs\n\nCIA malware and hacking tools are built by EDG (Engineering Development Group), a software development group within CCI (Center for Cyber Intelligence), a department belonging to the CIA's DDI (Directorate for Digital Innovation).",
      "The tens of thousands of routable IP addresses references (including more than 22 thousand within the United States) that correspond to possible targets, CIA covert listening post servers, intermediary and test systems, are redacted for further exclusive investigation.",
      "Improvise (JQJIMPROVISE)\n\n'Improvise' is a toolset for configuration, post-processing, payload setup and execution vector selection for survey/exfiltration tools supporting all major operating systems like Windows (Bartender), MacOS (JukeBox) and Linux (DanceFloor).",
      "A successful 'attack' on a target's computer system is more like a series of complex stock maneuvers in a hostile take-over bid or the careful planting of rumors in order to gain control over an organization's leadership rather than the firing of a weapons system.",
      "Another branch of development focuses on the development and operation of Listening Posts (LP) and Command and Control (C2) systems used to communicate with and control CIA implants; special projects are used to target specific hardware from routers to smart TVs.",
      "Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads.",
      "Over the last three years the United States intelligence sector, which consists of government agencies such as the CIA and NSA and their contractors, such as Booz Allan Hamilton, has been subject to unprecedented series of data exfiltrations by its own workers.",
      "By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other \"weaponized\" malware.",
      "The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems covering Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux and more, such as EDB's \"HIVE\" and the related \"Cutthroat\" and \"Swindle\" tools, which are described in the examples section below.",
      "The questionnaire is used by the agency's OSB (Operational Support Branch) to transform the requests of case officers into technical requirements for hacking attacks (typically \"exfiltrating\" information from computer systems) for specific operations.",
      "Since the organizational structure of the CIA below the level of Directorates is not public, the placement of the EDG and its branches within the org chart of the agency is reconstructed from information contained in the documents released so far.",
      "Securing such 'weapons' is particularly difficult since the same people who develop and use them have the skills to exfiltrate copies without leaving traces — sometimes by using the very same 'weapons' against the organizations that contain them.",
      "In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.",
      "If there is a military analogy to be made, the infestation of a target is perhaps akin to the execution of a whole series of military maneuvers against the target's territory including observation, infiltration, occupation and exploitation.",
      "Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability.",
      "While nuclear proliferation has been restrained by the enormous costs and visible infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a critical nuclear mass, cyber 'weapons', once developed, are very hard to retain.",
      "Over-redaction: Some items may have been redacted that are not employees, contractors, targets or otherwise related to the agency, but are, for example, authors of documentation for otherwise public projects that are used by the agency.",
      "U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt is a covert CIA hacker base\n\nIn addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa.",
      "These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the \"smart\" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.",
      "The CIA had created, in effect, its \"own NSA\" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.",
      "There are substantial price incentives for government hackers and consultants to obtain copies since there is a global \"vulnerability market\" that will pay hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for copies of such 'weapons'.",
      "The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer, so the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant.",
      "The U.S. government's commitment to the Vulnerabilities Equities Process came after significant lobbying by US technology companies, who risk losing their share of the global market over real and perceived hidden vulnerabilities.",
      "The Department of Justice alleged that it seized some 50,000 gigabytes of information from Harold T. Martin III that he had obtained from classified programs at NSA and CIA, including the source code for numerous hacking tools.",
      "Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA's Automated Implant Branch (AIB), which has developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as \"Assassin\" and \"Medusa\".",
      "The CIA attacks this software by using undisclosed security vulnerabilities (\"zero days\") possessed by the CIA but if the CIA can hack these phones then so can everyone else who has obtained or discovered the vulnerability.",
      "The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide.",
      "Examples\n\nThe CIA's Engineering Development Group (EDG) management system contains around 500 different projects (only some of which are documented by \"Year Zero\") each with their own sub-projects, malware and hacker tools.",
      "With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the \"fingerprints\" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.",
      "The project provides customizable implants for Windows, Solaris, MikroTik (used in internet routers) and Linux platforms and a Listening Post (LP)/Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with these implants.",
      "The implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS with the webserver of a cover domain; each operation utilizing these implants has a separate cover domain and the infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains.",
      "Webpages in this system (like in Wikipedia) have a version history that can provide interesting insights on how a document evolved over time; the 7818 documents include these page histories for 1136 latest versions.",
      "To witnesses, the spy appears to be running a program showing videos (e.g VLC), presenting slides (Prezi), playing a computer game (Breakout2, 2048) or even running a fake virus scanner (Kaspersky, McAfee, Sophos).",
      "If CIA implants, Command & Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet.",
      "Among the list of possible targets of the collection are 'Asset', 'Liason Asset', 'System Administrator', 'Foreign Information Operations', 'Foreign Intelligence Agencies' and 'Foreign Government Entities'.",
      "The first full part of the series, \"Year Zero\", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina.",
      "Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized \"zero day\" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation.",
      "Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade.",
      "As an example, specific CIA malware revealed in \"Year Zero\" is able to penetrate, infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts.",
      "The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.",
      "The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities.",
      "It is intended to be used as a rough outline of the internal organization; please be aware that the reconstructed org chart is incomplete and that internal reorganizations occur frequently.",
      "The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.",
      "Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open border area — including France, Italy and Switzerland.",
      "UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture, data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques.",
      "Attachments with other binary content are replaced by a hex dump of the content to prevent accidental invocation of binaries that may have been infected with weaponized CIA malware.",
      "Similarly, contractors and companies who obtain such 'weapons' sometimes use them for their own purposes, obtaining advantage over their competitors in selling 'hacking' services.",
      "WikiLeaks has intentionally not written up hundreds of impactful stories to encourage others to find them and so create expertise in the area for subsequent parts in the series.",
      "To exfiltrate data back to the CIA or to await further instructions the malware must communicate with CIA Command & Control (C2) systems placed on internet connected servers.",
      "CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate ( \"Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe\" or CCIE) are given diplomatic (\"black\") passports and State Department cover.",
      "CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote \"zero days\" developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop.",
      "Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone.",
      "\"Year Zero\" shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 \"weaponized\" Android \"zero days\" which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors.",
      "The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force — its own substantial fleet of hackers.",
      "Redactions\n\nNames, email addresses and external IP addresses have been redacted in the released pages (70,875 redactions in total) until further analysis is complete.",
      "By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone &mdsh; at the expense of leaving everyone hackable.",
      "Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the 'battlefield' of cyber 'war'.",
      "As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable.",
      "Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA's cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or cyber criminals.",
      "Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from 'Fine Dining' questionairies.",
      "Given the redaction process used a single person may be represented by more than one assigned identifier but no identifier refers to more than one real person.",
      "CIA malware targets Windows, OSx, Linux, routers\n\nThe CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware.",
      "This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA.",
      "It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.",
      "Each technique it has created forms a \"fingerprint\" that can be used by forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity.",
      "In order to infect target's device, copies of the malware must be placed on the target's devices, giving physical possession of the malware to the target.",
      "For instance, attempted \"malware injections\" (commercial jargon) or \"implant drops\" (NSA jargon) are being called \"fires\" as if a weapon was being fired.",
      "This information is used by the CIA's 'JQJIMPROVISE' software (see below) to configure a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation.",
      "A number of intelligence community members not yet publicly named have been arrested or subject to federal criminal investigations in separate incidents.",

      "Over the last decade U.S. hacking operations have been increasingly dressed up in military jargon to tap into Department of Defense funding streams.",
      "Most visibly, on February 8, 2017 a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Harold T. Martin III with 20 counts of mishandling classified information.",
      "A similar unit targets Google's Android which is used to run the majority of the world's smart phones (~85%) including Samsung, HTC and Sony.",

      "The attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose, which is inserted into the targeted computer.",
      "Some example projects are described below, but see the table of contents for the full list of projects described by WikiLeaks' \"Year Zero\".",
      "The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites.",
      "After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on.",
      "In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server.",
      "But such servers are typically not approved to hold classified information, so CIA command and control systems are also made unclassified.",

    "sentences": [
      "ROGERS: If when we disseminate -- if we decide we need -- if it's criminal activity, we'll disseminate the information and if the FBI or other criminal activities are on the reporting stream, in some cases I also will generate a signed letter under my signature in specific cases to Department of Justice highlighting that what we think we have is potential criminal activity, but because we are not a law enforcement or justice organization we're not in a place to make that determination.",
      "ROONEY: Just basically under the breath of that article, when we when we hear that nine former, current -- or current officials had spoken to the press under the condition of anonymity, and we heard our director Comey and the Chairman speak of this is a potential crime -- a serious crime -- under the Espionage Act, assuming if this article is accurate, who would have the -- who would be in a position to request the unmasking of General Flynn's identity?",
      "And if we -- I think that it's vital that for those who break that sacred trust, if they are not held accountable whether it by the NSA internally or by the FBI through conviction or investigations/prosecution and conviction through the attorney general's office of that crime, it is very difficult for us to be able to keep that sacred trust to know that what we're doing is -- is -- is valid and what we're doing has no nefarious motivations.",
      "I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.",
      "If this is used against the ability of us to reauthorize this tool and we can't get it done because whoever did this leak, or these nine people that did this leak, create such a stir, whether it be, you know, in our legislative process or whatever, that they don't feel confident that a U.S. person under the 702 program can be masked successfully and not leaked to the press, doesn't that hurt, that leak hurt our national security?",
      "This is by Professor Karen Dawisha who wrote, \"Instead of seeing Russian politics as an inchoate democratic system being pulled down by history, accidental autocrats, popular inertia, bureaucratic incompetence, or poor Western advice, I conclude that from the beginning Putin and his circle sought to create an authoritarian regime ruled by a close-knit cabal -- who used democracy for decoration rather than direction.\"",
      "I do want to specifically mention that among the collection and authorities that we have to target foreign actors in foreign spaces, FISA Section 702 and Executive Order 12333 have been instrumental in our ability to produce the intelligence made available to the committee and others in gathering the SIGINT facts of foreign activity in this election cycle.",
      "In February of this year, the Washington Post reported nine, nine current and former officials who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the call, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters and that officials began pouring over intelligence reports, intercepted communications, and diplomatic cables.",
      "We'll also examine whether the intelligence community's assessment of the Russian operation is supported by the raw intelligence, whether the U.S. government responded properly or missed the opportunity to stop this Russian attack much earlier and whether the leak of information about Michael Flynn or others is indicative of a systemic problem.",
      "As the committee fully knows, the intelligence community has a long-standing policy of not discussing surveillance targeting information, in particular cases, as to do so would invariably open the door to compel further disclosures and litigation or the release of classified information, all of which would be harmful to our national security.",
      "Admiral Rogers, thanks for confirming that, but am I correct, that the -- when we say Russian hacking what we are referring to is the fact that the intelligence community believes that the Russians penetrated the networks of the DNC, of John Podesta, and other individuals, stole information and then disseminated that information.",
      "But as the ranking member pointed out, it perhaps should come as no surprise that the Republican platform, which was drafted at the Republican Convention in July of 2016, underwent a pretty significant change with respect to the American response to Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and their aggression in that country.",
      "And I wanna underscore something my friend Mike Rogers said, leaks of classified information are serious, serious federal crimes for a reason...\n\n(AUDIO GAP)\n\nCOMEY: ... they should be investigated and where possible prosecuted in a way that reflects that seriousness so that people understand it simply cannot be tolerated.",
      "GOWDY: Director Comey, I am not arguing with you and I do agree that culture is important, but if there are 100 people who have the ability to unmask and the knowledge of a previously masked name, then that's 100 different potential sources of investigation and the smaller the number is, the easier your investigation is.",
      "ROGERS: No sir, I -- I mean I have raised this directly with my own workforce over the -- over the course of the last few months to remind everyone, part of the ethics of our profession, not just the legal requirement but the ethics of our profession as intelligence professionals is we do not engage in this activity.",
      "If -- if -- if what we're talking about is a serious crime as has -- as has been alleged, in your opinion, would leaking of an -- a U.S. person who has been unmasked and disseminated by intelligence community officials, would that leaking to the press hurt or help our ability to conduct national security matters?",
      "ROONEY: And — and what you do when it went something like that happens, if there's a U.S. person part of an incidental collection, what kind of safeguards are put in place to make sure that...\n\nROGERS: So it depends specifically on the legal authority that we're using to execute the collection in the first place.",
      "The lobbying was only discovered by Ukraine's new National Anti- Corruption Bureau, which found secret ledgers in Kiev, indicating almost $13 million in undisclosed cash payments from Ukrainian government coffers (ph), to Paul Manafort for lobbying done between 2007 and 2012, for Mr. Yanukovych -- Yanukovych.",
      "We come into contact with U.S. persons a whole lot more than the NSA does because we may be conducting -- we only conduct our operations in the United States to collect electronic surveillance -- to conduct electronic surveillance, so I don't -- I can find out the exact number, I don't know it as I sit here.",
      "And further, apart from these weird links, without exception, the individuals I've quoted have dissembled or misled, maybe even lied about the nature of those -- those connections until the political pressure has gotten to a point where they have been fired or recused, in the case of the Attorney General.",
      "And again in February of this year, the New York Times reported on a phone call involving a U.S. citizen including significant discussions of phone records, intercepted calls, intercepted communications, and reported the NSA captured calls and then asked the FBI to collect as much information as possible.",
      "Like the committee, we are also greatly concerned about leaks of classified information as they can reveal the sources and methods we employ to provide intelligence to American policymakers and warfighters and generate advantage for our nation while protecting its citizens and interest and their privacy.",
      "I can tell you in general, as -- as Admiral Rogers and I were just saying, there is a statutory framework in the United States under which courts grant permission for electronic surveillance either in a criminal case or a national security case based on a showing of probable cause, carefully overseen.",
      "I can tell you we use our great, great people, we coordinate with our brothers and sisters in other parts of the intelligence community to see what they may know from around the world that might be useful to us and we use all the different tools and techniques that we use in all of our investigations.",
      "SCHIFF: Director Rogers, in an effort to explain why there was no evidence supporting the president's claim that Obama had wiretapped him, the president and his spokesman, Sean Spicer, have suggested that British intelligence through its NSA or GCHQ wiretapped Mr. Trump on President Obama's behalf.",
      "At the request of congressional leaders, we have taken the extraordinary step in coordination with the Department of Justice of briefing this Congress' leaders, including the leaders of this committee, in a classified setting in detail about the investigation but I can't go into those details here.",
      "The Russian active measures campaign may have begun as early as 2015, when Russian intelligence services launched a series of spear fishing attacks designed to penetrate the computers of a broad array of Washington based Democratic and Republican party organizations, think tanks and other entities.",
      "Is it a coincidence that Michael Flynn would lie about a conversation he had with the same Russian Ambassador Kislyak, about the most pressing issue facing both countries at the time they spoke, the U.S. imposition of sanctions over Russian hacking of our election designed to help Donald Trump?",
      "I know that we're going through the 90 minute mark in this hearing so let me step back a second and just review the topics because there's a lot on the table and I think my friends on the Republican side will get no argument from this side on the importance of investigating, prosecuting leaks.",
      "And I -- I raise this with you because the story is told of Paul Manafort acting on behalf of Ukraine's former justice miniature -- minister Oleksandr Lavrynovych, which who was the justice minister under the previous pro-Russian regime who -- and I'll just read a segment from the story here.",
      "If we come to the conclusion that it is a U.S. person and we ask ourselves are we — are we listening to criminal activity, are we seeing something of imminent threat or danger, for example, or are we just receiving something that has nothing to do with any of our valid collection authority?",
      "We at NSA have strict procedures in place to make sure that our reporting and the contents of our reporting are disseminated only to those that have strict need-to- know for valid purposes which primarily means support of the development of foreign policy and to protect national security.",
      "As you know, our practice is not to confirm the existence of ongoing investigations, especially those investigations that involve classified matters, but in unusual circumstances where it is in the public interest, it may be appropriate to do so as Justice Department policies recognize.",
      "If it was something or somebody, say, really important would that matter or could it be...\n\nROGERS: Not -- it's not necessarily designated in writing that way, but certainly by custom and tradition, at times requests will be pushed up to my -- I'm the senior-most of the 20 individuals.",
      "ROONEY: OK. Based on that, again, hypothetically, if the NSA obtained the communication of General Flynn while he was communicating with the surveillance target legally, would you please explain how General Flynn's identity could be unmasked based on the exceptions that we discussed?",
      "ROGERS: So again, we use two criteria; the need to know on the person requesting us in the execution of their official duties and the second part was, is the identification necessary to truly understand the context of the intelligence value that the report is designed to generate?",
      "ROONEY: Right and -- and what -- and what we're talking about here, is incidentally, if a U.S. person is talking to a foreign person that we're listening to, whether or not that person is unmasked...\n\nROGERS: I just wanna make sure we all understand the context, that's all.",
      "Our analysts have consistently proven to be reliable and thorough in their technical and analytic efforts and providing our policymakers and warfighters with SIGINT ammunition to make informed decisions to protect our nation's freedom and ensure the safety of its citizens.",
      "ROGERS: ... that -- that...\n\nSCHIFF: Director Rogers, President Trump recently met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a joint press conference, the president suggested that they both had something in common, that they had both been wiretapped by President Obama.",
      "So, with respect to the coordination, Director Comey, I just wanted to continue this line of questioning, can you say with any specificity what kinds of coordination or contacts you're looking at in your investigation generally when confronted with something like this?",
      "Manafort categorically denies involvement by the Trump campaign and altering the platform, but the Republican Party delegate who offered the language in support of providing defensive weapons to Ukraine states it was removed at the insistence of the Trump campaign.",
      "According to Christopher Steele, a British — a former British intelligence officer, who is reportedly held in high regard by U.S. intelligence, Russian sources tell him that Page has also had a secret meeting with Igor Sechin, CEO of the Russian gas giant, Rosneft.",
      "GOWDY: I know the department struggled with it, the 4th Circuit struggled with it, lots of people have struggled with it but you're not aware of an exception in the current dissemination of classified information statute that carves out an exception for reporters.",
      "Two things folks at home should know; first, an unauthorized disclosure of FISA is an extraordinarily unusual event so be assured we're going to take it very seriously because our trust, the American people, and the federal judges that oversee our work, is vital.",
      "ROONEY: Well, I think that, you know, as we move forward, obviously, you know, I think that what you're speaking of is this sacred trust that the intelligence community has with the American people and with the people that are representing them here on this dais.",
      "Is this truly something that involves intelligence or a national security implication for the United States or is this just very normal, reasonable conversations, in which case we have no desire to have any awareness of it, it's not applicable to our mission.",
      "NUNES: Would an unauthorized disclosure of FISA-derived information to the press violate 18 USC 798, a section of the Espionage Act that criminalizes the disclosure of information concerning the communication and intelligence activities of the United States?",

      "If you'd heard of representative Devin Nunes before this week, you're either from his California district or you pay closer than average attention to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which he leads.",
      "Friday morning, March 24: Nunes cancels a planned open Intelligence Committee hearing that was to feature former ODNI head James Clapper, former CIA director John Brennan, and former deputy attorney general Sally Yates.",
      "Nunes says the reports came from FISA surveillance, which means that foreign nationals who the intelligence community has eyes on either talked to or about the president-elect and his transition team at some point.",
      "Thursday night, April 11: CNN reports that, after having reviewed the same documents that prompted the original Nunes allegations, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers found nothing \"unusual or illegal.\"",
      "Below, we’ve cobbled together a brief timeline of the Nunes claims from last week, based on publicly available information, various reports, and statements from both Nunes and his colleagues.",
      "In that capacity, Nunes also heads up the House investigation into Russian's interference in last year's presidential election, as well as any ties between Russia and Trump or his colleagues.",
      "Thursday morning, April 6: Due to an ethics complaint, Devin Nunes steps down from his leadership of the Russia investigation, leaving open the possibility of return after an inquiry.",
      "Democrats on the panel respond by noting that it was Nunes who canceled a previously scheduled open panel scheduled with no explanation and no apparent intent to reschedule.",
      "It's becoming increasingly clear, though, that the way Nunes came into this information, and the way he disseminated it, holds more intrigue than his original allegations.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump says he feels “somewhat vindicated” after the Nunes briefing, despite no evidence that Trump Tower was wiretapped (which is what he had claimed).",
      "(The short version: The kind of “incidental collection” Nunes described has nothing to do with direct surveillance of Trump, his associates, or Trump Tower).",
      "Instead, the bipartisan consensus appears to be that Susan Rice was simply doing her job, and that no politically motivated attempts to unmask took place.",
      "But the need for a SCIF doesn’t explain the use of the White House; the Capitol building houses several of them and sits just 15 minutes away by car.",
      "At his daily press briefing, Press Secretary Sean Spicer declines to comment, saying he chooses to focus more on the \"substance\" than the \"process.\"",
      "It was a remarkable breach of protocol—one that, like some sort of inverse Magic Eye poster, becomes more confusing the longer you look at it.",
      "His statement reads, in full:\n\n\"Several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics.",
      "\"I think to some degree there are some things he should look at to see whether, in fact, he thinks the collection was proper or not.\"",
      "Tuesday evening, March 21: Devin Nunes takes a phone call while sharing a ride with a staffer, according to The Washington Post.",
      "President Trump and his associates, Nunes declared, had been caught up in surveillance by US intelligence agencies.",
      "When pressed on Democrat concerns that he's too close to Trump, Nunes responds that it \"sounds like their problem.\"",
      "The initial Nunes surveillance claims are plenty problematic on their own, and we’ve discussed them before.",
      "Further complicating matters is the fact that Nunes was an adviser to Trump's transition team.",
      "That’s apparently referring to a SCIF, a protected room used to share classified materials.",
      "Directly after, he holds another press conference, this time on the White House lawn.",
      "Later Tuesday morning, Nunes declines to recuse himself from the investigation.",
      "Next, Nunes visits the White House to brief Trump on the intelligence reports.",

      "After the call, he switches cars without telling his team where he’s going.",
      "House Speaker Paul Ryan also said he saw no reason for Nunes to step aside.",
      "Nunes then rushed to the White House to share the information in person.",
      "Nunes also tells the committee that they’ll see the documents on Friday.",
      "We will continue to update this post as the Nunes situation evolves.",
      "Wednesday, he held an extraordinary, impromptu news conference.",
      "There’s nothing either incriminating or surprising about this.",

    "sentences": [
      "If something else happens, it appears to me like there were things like maybe they didn’t meet the level of foreign intelligence value, and if that’s the case -\n\nReporter: But just to clarify, this is not intentional spying on Donald Trump or anyone in his—\n\nNunes: I have no idea—we won’t know that until we get to the bottom of whether, did people ask for the unmasking of additional names on the President-elect’s transition team.",
      "Nunes: Well, I think the wiretapping, if you use it generally, the President has said, he clearly used it differently than what I think a lot of people took it—did Obama wiretap Trump Tower which we knew didn’t happen—I think the President has been pretty clear on that—\n\nReporter: But the physical act of wiretapping, do you see anything in the information that—\n\nNunes: No, no.",
      "Reporter: [Unintelligible]\n\nNunes: I’m not going to get into the sources, or when it arrived, but I wanted to brief the Speaker, which is what I did this morning, and obviously I briefed, I put in calls to the directors, I’ve spoken to the CIA Director and the NSA Director, and I’m waiting to talk to Director Comey, and I’m going to head to the White House after the votes.",
      "We went through this about a year and a half ago as it related to members of Congress, if you may remember there was a report—I think it was in the Wall Street Journal—and there was a whole series of hearings, and then we had to have changes as to how members of Congress are informed if members of Congress are picked up in surveillance.",
      "Nunes: This is information that was brought to me that I thought the President needed to know about incidental collection, where the President himself and others in the Trump transition team were clearly put into intelligence reports that ended up in this White House and across a whole bunch of other agencies.",
      "Some significant developments, I think, occurred of the course of the last few days with information that was brought to my attention, and I’m gonna just sort of read a very brief statement, and that’s about all I can tell you, but I want to keep you fully informed of what’s, uh, happening.",
      "Nunes, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, went to the White House Wednesday afternoon to tell the president about the communications because, he said, he was concerned that the information might have been improperly distributed to several U.S. spy agencies.",
      "Nunes: Well, what we’ve said from day one that there wasn’t a physical wiretap of Trump Tower, we don’t have any evidence to show that at all, but what I read—there was clearly significant information about President Trump and his team and there were additional names that were unmasked.",
      "Reporter: Given that you have said there was a FISA warrant which would have been approved by a judge, are you concerned that essentially you’re saying that members of the Trump team were in contact with people who were the target of a counterintelligence or some form of investigation?",
      "Reporter: So let me just clarify: the president of the United States’s personal communications were intercepted as an incidental part of—\n\nNunes: Well what I think we have—well what I think we have—when we talk about intelligence products here, we’ve got to be very careful.",
      "Reporter: Was it information that was looked at it in real time, or was it information that was collected, held, scored -\n\nNunes: It was fairly quick, from what I’ve seen, but we have to—once we get the reports, we can ask more questions of the agencies that produced them.",
      "So bluntly put, everything that I was able to view did not involve Russia or any discussions with Russia,s or any trump people or other Russians talking, or, so none of it has to do with Russia—that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist, it just means we don’t have it.",
      "Reporter: You said it has nothing to do with Russia and you’re folding this in—\n\nNunes: Well, you’re folding this in—the unmasking of names—\n\nReporter: So an ongoing investigation and you thought it was appropriate to come and talk to the President about that.",
      "Nunes: I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show, that, uh, the President-elect and his team were I guess at least monitored and disseminated out in intelligence, in what appears to be raw—well I shouldn’t say raw—but intelligence reporting channels.",
      "Before I get to questions I want to say that, uh, as you know there has been what appears to be a terrorist attack in the United Kingdom, obviously very concerned and our thoughts and prayers go out to our strong friends and allies over across the pond.",
      "Nunes: You—what I’ve read, there seems to me to be some level of surveillance activity, perhaps legal, but I don’t know that it’s right and I don’t know that the American people would be comfortable with what I read, but let us get all the reports.",
      "There were dozens of reports that I was able to see and we’re hoping that the NSA, FBI, CIA will provide—I know they exist, so I want them to provide them to our committee—so that all the members have an opportunity to see what I have been shown.",
      "Rep. Devin Nunes (R-California) announced Wednesday that he had seen evidence that communications between President Donald Trump and members of his transition team were \"incidentally collected\" during surveillance operations of foreign targets.",
      "But I had to brief the speaker first, then I had to talk to the NSA, the CIA Director, then I have to talk to the FBI Director, then I had to talk to all of you, and then I voted, and then I said I was coming here to brief the President.",
      "Reporter: Wait, so what was found, just to be clear—it was—the material that you have seen so far, doesn’t make any reference or connection to Russia, or are you saying the incidental investigations themselves more broadly were not?",
      "Reporter: Did you receive this from members of the intelligence community who are officially communicating it to you, or was this—\n\nNunes: I don’t want to get into this, for the protections of American citizens, as you can imagine.",
      "I’ve only—like I said, I’ve seen dozens of reports, I don’t know if there’s more than that, but clearly I thought it was important enough to tell all of you, inform the speaker, and then go to the White House and inform them.",
      "They know how important these programs are, they are in constant communication with our team, and as you know they partially complied with our request last week, and I expect them to hopefully get more information by Friday.",
      "And it appears, just to give you one piece of information I think might be helpful, it appears most of this occurred from what I’ve seen in November, December, and January, so that should probably—so during the transition.",
      "At our open hearing on Monday, I encouraged anyone who has information about relative topics, including surveillance on President-elect Trump or his transition team, to come forward and speak to members of the Committee.",
      "Nunes: It—look, a lot of it appears like it was, it looks to me like it was all legally collected, but it was essentially a lot of information on the President-elect and his transition team and what they were doing.",
      "And I think it should bother the President himself and his team, because I think some of it seems to be inappropriate, but like I said, before we get all the information to the committee, it’s hard to really say.",
      "Nunes: I guess, from what I read, it just—it bothers me that that would have any foreign intelligence value whatsoever, and why people would need to know that about president elect trump and his transition team.",
      "Nunes: Because until I get all the information in its entirety from all the agencies, then we can go through it and we can go back and ask those kinds of questions, but I would just be speculating at this point.",
      "Reporter: You said you’re not confident where collection took place and you’re not confident who it involves—\n\nNunes: No, because all I was able to see was reports—reports on information that was collected.",
      "I’ve asked the directors of FBI, NSA, and CIA to expeditiously comply with my March 15th letter that you all received a couple of weeks ago, and provide a full account of these surveillance activities.",
      "And it was, it had, there were no references whatsoever in everything that I read, and it was dozens, let’s just say, let’s leave it at that, dozens of reports, and there was no mention of Russia.",
      "The House Intelligence Committee will thoroughly investigate the surveillance, and its subsequent dissemination, to determine, a few things here that I want to read off:\n\nWho was aware of it?",
      "Nunes: Uh, no, I mean, we’re doing our investigation, we’re following the facts where they lead, and clearly I thought this was important enough to come publicly and say what I have so far.",
      "Nunes apologized Thursday to Democrats on the committee for not sharing the information with them before he went to the White House to talk to the president about what he had been given.",
      "Details about persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting.",
      "Today I briefed the President on the concerns that I had about incidental collection and how it relates to President-elect Trump and his transition team, and the concerns that I had.",
      "Reporter: The surveillance—if it wasn’t related to Russia or anything like that, are you saying that it was political surveillance of political opponents, as suggested in his tweets?",
      "Reporter: If it’s legal collection, wouldn’t it be inappropriate of you to talk about it, and are you attempting to give the president political cover in his talk about wiretapping?",
      "This appears to be all legally collected foreign intelligence under FISA, where there was incidental collection that then ended up in reporting channels and was widely disseminated.",
      "Reporter: So you said that the president’s communications were incidentally collected, but then you said it’s also possible, so was it collected or is it possible it was collected?",
      "In the dozens of reports I was able to see, I was able to determine that it looks like it was legal collection, incidental collection, that made itself into intelligence reports.",
      "There’s additional unmasking of names, which I think is totally inappropriate, but we—I don’t know how many names were unmasked, but I know these additional unmaskings occurred.",
      "Clearly it bothers me enough, I’m not comfortable with it, and I want to make sure that the White House understands it and that’s why I briefed the Speaker this morning on this.",
      "I also said that while there was no a physical wiretap of Trump Tower, I was concerned that other surveillance activities were used against President Trump and his associates.",
      "So first, I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.",
      "And I’ll tell you, NSA is being cooperative, but the FBI has not yet let us know whether they’re going to respond to our March 15th letter, which is now a few weeks old.",
      "It has everything to do with surveillance activities, and the President needs to know that these intelligence reports are out there, and I have a duty to tell him that.",
      "They came through the proper channels and have clearances and I’m just going to leave it at that because we have to protect people who came forward in the right manner.",
      "I informed Speaker Ryan this morning of this information, and I will be going to the White House this afternoon to share what I know with the president and his team.",
      "FBI director James Comey said Monday that the agency is investigating any possible connection between the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the election.",
      "Reporter: So you don’t know if the president’s communications were—\n\nNunes: Look, I know that there was collection, regarding the President-elect and his team.",
      "Reporter: And again, does this seem to describe what the President was talking about, he was talking about, quote, wiretapping, which he then said was broader?",
      "Nunes: I haven’t had a chance to brief a lot of you in the past, but just to have a chance to keep you updated with what’s happening with this investigation.",
      "Reporter: Do you believe the President appropriately used the word wiretap, was it used correctly in his tweets, based on the information that you have seen?",
      "And forth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia, or the investigation of Russian activities, or of the Trump team.",
      "And lastly I’ll say that the reports that I was able to see did not have anything to do with Russia or the Russia investigation or any ties the Trump team.",
      "Why is it appropriate for you to brief President Trump given that it’s his own administration or campaign associates that are a part of this investigation?",
      "Reporter: Can you just say, do you think right now, the NSA or a member of the intelligence community was spying on Trump during the transition period?",
      "Are you suggesting that Mr. Trump [unintelligible] And third, why did you not take this up with Representative Schiff before going to the White House?",
      "We have scoping document in the Russia investigation and we will continue to investigate anything and everything else that might be caught up in this.",
      "Reporter: Mr. Chairman, did the president’s conversations or anything about the president appear in intelligence reports, is that what you’re saying?",
      "The information collected had nothing to do with the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the chairman said.",
      "And then who was on the dissemination list, and was the dissemination list so far if it was such specific information about the Trump transition.",
      "Reporter: Will this broaden the scope of your investigation, and what do you think of Democrats’ calls for an independent commission or counsel?",
      "Reporter: What is it about the surveillance itself that alarms you if that was possibly just routine incidental collection on a foreign target?",
      "I’m really bothered by the unmasking, which is why we sent that letter on the 15th, because I want to see what additional names were unmasked.",
      "Nunes: The reason that we do this, that we have all these procedures in place, is to protect American citizens who are incidentally collected.",
      "Reporter: So the president of the United States’s personal communications were intercepted in incidental collection, not in a targeted way?",
      "Nunes: As of right now that’s what I’ve seen, but it’s hard to know until we get all the information and talk to the appropriate agencies.",
      "Nunes: It definitely goes beyond what happened to General Flynn—now of course, we don’t officially know yet what happened to Gen. Flynn.",
      "Reporter: Specifically are we talking about Paul Manafort, like here and his communications, or any other senior level Trump officials?",
      "And then we have the additional issue of the names that were put into these intelligence reports that we have to get to the bottom of.",
      "This is normal intelligence reporting, the question is, should he himself or others - should they have been put into these reports.",
      "Nunes: I would refer to you to—we had a similar issue with members of Congress that were being picked up in incidental collection.",
      "Reporter: We knew that there was some incidental collection, because Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was caught talking to Sergey Kislyak.",
      "…\n\nReporter: Does this change—you’ve said repeatedly that the President was wrong when he said he was wiretapped at Trump Tower.",
      "Reporter: Are you concerned that any of the surveillance was done illegally, or as incidental but a legal, you know, a warrant .",
      "Can you give us some idea—\n\nNunes: The information that I have seen has nothing to do with Russia or the Russian investigations.",
      "We don’t have the full scope of all the intelligence reports that have been produced or who ordered the unmasking of the names.",
      "Nunes: Well, we don’t know who sent the taskings, if the taskings were changed into what went into these intelligence reports.",
      "It has to do with FISA, and there are multiple FISA warrants that are out there, but there’s nothing criminal at all involved.",
      "Nunes: Yes, no, and I’m going to be meeting with Mr. Schiff at some point to talk about where to go with this investigation.",
      "Below is the transcript of the second press conference, held at the White House following Nunes’ meeting with the president.",
      "Reporter: Did you have permission to put out this information today, did the Justice Department give you the OK to do that?",
      "Nunes: Remember, we have had an ongoing investigation into Russia for a very, very long time, and all of their activities.",
      "Are you suggesting these communications could have been collected as part of a criminal investigation, a criminal warrant?",
      "The question is was it masked, why was it unmasked because it appears we have no information about additional unmaskings.",
      "Reporter: How can you be confident, then, that it did not have anything to do with Russia and the Russia investigation?",
      "Reporter: Did you see anything to suggest that President Obama ordered any kind of surveillance on the President-elect?",
      "Nunes: Well, the administration isn’t aware of this, so I need to make sure I go over there and tell them what I know.",
      "Reporter: So your issue is the unmasking, not that there was [unintelligible]\n\nNunes: Well, there’s two issues here.",
      "We don’t have—I was only able to see a few dozen, of which I think a lot of it does have foreign intelligence value.",
      "That’s why we asked in our March 15th letter for the NSA, CIA, and FBI to get us all the unmasking that was done.",
      "Reporter: How many people are you seeing in these reports, and do any of them currently work at the White House?",
      "This was information brought to me by sources and I’m hoping that NSA, FBI, CIA get me anything else they have.",
      "Reporter: Just to clarify, you’re concerned about this but you’re not calling for an additional investigation?",
      "We had to spend a full year working with the DNI on proper procedures for members of Congress to be notified.",
      "Reporter: [Unintelligible] surveillance, then they have to have a basis for surveillance, isn’t that correct?",
      "Reporter: Can you rule out the possibility that senior Obama administration officials were involved in this?",
      "Does this go beyond that, and does this qualify as the kind of wiretapping the President was tweeting about?",
      "Nunes: I’m not drawing any conclusions, I’m just telling the President what exists in intelligence reports.",
      "I’ve said this for many, many weeks, including the day after or a couple days after in front of the press.",
      "Nunes: I’m not going to get into that, but I have every indication that it’s clear who’s in these reports.",
      "Reporter: Is it the surveillance itself that alarms you or is it the unmasking and dissemination, or both?",
      "Nunes: Yeah, so this information was legally brought to be by sources who thought that we should know it.",
      "Nunes: Because what I saw has nothing to do with Russia and nothing to do with the Russia investigation.",
      "Reporter: So this was about President Trump, but not necessarily about his communications specifically?",
      "Reporter: You said you have to go and brief the administration—\n\nSomeone: Please talk to the cameras!",
      "And I have spoke to Admiral Rogers about these concerns, and he wants to comply as quickly as he can.",
      "Here is the transcript from Rep. Nunes’ first press conference on Wednesday\n\n“Good morning everyone.",
      "And this looks like—it’s very similar to that, it reminds me of what happened a year and a half ago.",
      "Reporter: Is there definitely none of this pre-election, is this all during the transition period?",
      "That’s why I briefed the Speaker this morning, and that’s why I came down here as soon as I could.",
      "We’re hopeful we’re going to get the information I’ve seen plus a lot more information on Friday.",
      "As best as I can say that until I can actually get all of the information that we’ve requested.",
      "We don’t know exactly how that was picked up, umm, but we’re trying to get to the bottom of it.",
      "There are certain thresholds that have to be met to make it into foreign intelligence products.",
      "Can you tell us anything—\n\nNunes: I can say that we’ve been asking for people to come forward.",
      "Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked.",
      "Reporter: Just to be clear, were these communications actually collected inside Trump Tower?",
      "Reporter: And that was [unintelligible] by the person that brought that information to you?",
      "Reporter: Mr. Nunes, were any of these communications potentially picked up at Trump Tower?",
      "Nunes: I’m not going to get into legal definitions here, but clearly I have a concern.",
      "I don’t want to get too much into these details, but these were intelligence reports.",
      "It brings up a lot of concerns about whether things were properly minimized or not.",
      "I have placed a call, I’m waiting to talk to Director Comey, hopefully later today.",
      "We just know that his name leaked out, but we don’t know how it was picked up yet.",
      "I don’t know the answer to that yet, but we’re trying to get to the bottom of it.",
      "Can you tell us what he was communicating about or who he was communicating with?",

      "BARTIROMO: Have you moved off of this soft deadline that your team put in place of August to get this done?",
      "Health care has been going along — you know, it's in negotiations (INAUDIBLE) and it's just a negotiation.",
      "Then the next day, it was another schedule, because everything is very orderly with the Chinese, frankly.",
      "TRUMP: I'm not like Obama, where they talk about in four months we're waiting — we're going to hit Mosul.",
      "The 15 minutes on the second day lasted for two hours, just one-on-one, the two of us with interpreters.",
      "So what happens is I said we've just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq and I wanted you to know this.",
      "We haven't failed, we're negotiating and we continue to negotiate and we will save perhaps $900 billion.",
      "But, you know, we have to just — look, I have so many people that want to come into this administration.",
      "And it's going to take a little while longer, but as you're probably hearing, Congress is coming along.",
      "That means we have to get close to 100 percent of the Republicans, not an easy way to run a government.",
      "So I think that money — because we've been saying that number for, what, five years now, would you say?",
      "TRUMP: Are many, many of the — and this is going to be a much worse year than last year for ObamaCare.",
      "BARTIROMO: How do you know you're not going to have a similar battle on the tax...\n\nTRUMP: Oh, I will.",
      "And they'd fight a little bit during the day and then they'd have dinner with their families at night.",
      "Are you going to put...\n\nTRUMP: No, I don't want to talk about that, I want to talk about (INAUDIBLE).",
      "He even appeared to brag about striking Syria while eating dessert with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "TRUMP: And in the meantime, they get ready and like you've never seen — look, they're still fighting.",
      "We have submarines, very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you.",
      "And I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded, what do you do?",
      "And we have to do health care first to pick up additional money so that we get great tax reform.",
      "You know, you've been hearing — you've been using — and you keep using it, $2.5 trillion, right?",
      "If you had to one, can you do just...\n\nTRUMP: Yes, well, we...\n\nBARTIROMO: — corporate tax cuts?",
      "But if you add it all up and if they take every little word, they'll say oh, they're different.",
      "BARTIROMO: When you were with the president of China, you're launching these military strikes.",
      "So we're serving tremendous amounts of money on health care when we get this done, number one.",
      "But if they make a motorcycle and they sell it back into the United States, they have no tax.",
      "BARTIROMO: — (INAUDIBLE) to be, because you've got a border adjustment tax...\n\nTRUMP: I will.",
      "BARTIROMO: — who's to say that tax reform doesn't fail the way the bill — the House bill did?",
      "And I'm not just saying in the last 90 days, I'm saying this has been for the last few years.",
      "I have had — I have watched speculation for three days now on what that was like (INAUDIBLE).",
      "TRUMP: So he paused for 10 seconds and then he asked the interpreter to please say it again.",
      "If you don't do that, you can't put any of the savings into the tax cuts and the tax reform.",
      "But we want them to expand their plants and build new plants and that's what they're doing.",
      "I mean at least I had a great chemistry — maybe he didn't like me, but I think he liked me.",
      "But I'll let you know soon, because they're going to be finishing that meeting pretty soon.",
      "TRUMP: But the money — the corporate inversions and the money over there is $2.5 trillion.",
      "TRUMP: They may not like it, but they can't get angry because they can't win that battle.",
      "ObamaCare was just, you know, they just, in the end, just gave up just to get the vote.",
      "You look at that, look at Hillary Clinton failed and you look at so many of the others.",
      "They had a very big attack and everybody waited, what's going on, and nothing happened.",
      "BARTIROMO: That's all (INAUDIBLE)...\n\nTRUMP: You know I don't think about the military.",
      "I mean look, we have, in terms of technology, nobody can even come close to competing.",
      "He's going to have meetings and then he's coming back and I'll certainly let us know.",
      "So I said, look, you have a tremendous power because of trading through the border.",
      "Well, they don't say that the other countries are charging you much more than that.",
      "And you know the funny thing is that nobody gets angry when you say reciprocal tax.",
      "And it's not only the high techs, it's also because the bureaucracy is so horrible.",
      "\"The New York Times\" said the word wiretapped in the headline of the first edition.",
      "But by putting a deadline, they say, oh, Trump didn't make it, he didn't make it.",
      "Nobody believes that, even the people that try to protect her in the news media.",
      "And in fact, they had a big attack right after he drew the red line in the sand.",
      "But I think he understood the message and I understood what he was saying to me.",
      "TRUMP: They'd leave, they would sell their cars in, they'd fire all our people.",
      "BARTIROMO: But do you have to do health care before tax reform...\n\nTRUMP: Yes.",
      "We are going to have we are going to have tax reform at some point very soon.",
      "But the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do health care first.",
      "If they don't get food, they don't get, you know, they can't sell their coal.",
      "Perhaps I didn't know how right I was, because nobody knew the extent of it.",
      "Director Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton, that I can tell you.",
      "So we're going to have a much better plan than ObamaCare, which is failing.",
      "TRUMP: But I'll tell you (INAUDIBLE)...\n\nBARTIROMO: Before dessert or what?",
      "But we got along — there was a great feeling, I think, between both of us.",
      "Our technology, our equipment, is better than anybody by a factor of five.",
      "Below is the full transcript, with the key parts highlighted and analyzed.",
      "But in terms of jobs, I mean I think both, but I think probably corporate.",
      "Tax reform is going to be tough, but it won't be as tough as health care.",
      "I said you've got to help us with North Korea, because we can't allow it.",
      "And then Obama made one of the worst deals in history with the Iran deal.",
      "TRUMP: You have no idea how many people want to hear the answer to this.",
      "BARTIROMO: You redirected navy ships to go toward the Korean Peninsula.",
      "And in all fairness, you see the same kids — no arms, no legs, no face.",
      "So I have people — hundreds of people that we're trying to get through.",
      "TRUMP: And then the newspapers will say Trump doesn't get them through.",
      "TRUMP: No, it's not too late, but, you know, I have confidence in him.",
      "And most importantly, actually, we're going to have great health care.",
      "And after that, we're going to start on tax reform and infrastructure.",
      "You saw that with Justice Gorsuch, which is — who we're very proud of.",
      "Susan Rice...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: — does anybody really believe that?",
      "And we made a determination to do it, so the missiles were on the way.",
      "Now, we have two very different countries, two very different peoples.",
      "In other words, we've just launched 59 missiles heading toward Syria.",
      "I mean the car industry is not going to leave us anymore, believe me.",
      "TRUMP: I think tax reform will be easier, but it's going to be tough.",
      "They sell very low, because the tax is 100 percent in some countries.",
      "TRUMP: — could keep trade and we could keep certain things separate.",
      "You have the moderate Republicans and you have to get them together.",
      "And those three people, you know, are to be respected for doing it.",
      "I think he's, you know, a person that I got along with really well.",
      "And frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person.",
      "And I want you to know that, because I didn't want him to go home.",
      "If ObamaCare isn't bailed out almost on a monthly basis, it fails.",
      "TRUMP: Well, because I want to give everybody a good, fair chance.",
      "When he was reading those charges, she was guilty on every charge.",
      "We freed up so much and we're getting great, great credit for it.",
      "And even the Obama people admitted he was wrong for not doing it.",
      "Look, he ran ExxonMobil for many years and it was flawlessly run.",
      "Don't forget, when Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton.",
      "It's been very much misreported that we failed with health care.",
      "But he — she wasn't OK, because she was guilty on every charge.",
      "You can call it a reciprocal or a matching tax or a mirror tax.",
      "So you really have Iran and you have Russia and you have Assad.",
      "Now, he then explains thousands of years of history with Korea.",
      "Well, the 15 minutes on the first day lasted for three hours.",
      "I have a very, very good meeting with President Xi of China.",
      "Now, if it doesn't happen fast enough, I'll start the taxes.",
      "It's such a big story and I'm sure it will continue forward.",
      "BARTIROMO: She said she didn't do it for political reasons.",
      "They're saying you know, you were right when you said that.",
      "BARTIROMO: Has it gotten in the way of getting things done?",
      "So when I hear border adjustment, adjustment means we lose.",
      "And I said, Mr. President, let me explain something to you.",
      "And they came back with a number of different alternatives.",
      "I'm going to be speaking to him tonight at 10:00, actually.",
      "They've had tremendous conflict with Korea over the years.",
      "We may put it in the tax code or we may keep it separate.",
      "BARTIROMO: — the deductions, so...\n\nTRUMP: That's right.",
      "BARTIROMO: Mr. President, just a final question for you.",
      "And then they'll say, why isn't Trump doing this faster?",
      "You know, we're talking about records in terms of time.",
      "If he weren't, she would be, right now, going to trial.",
      "Then they took it out of there fast when they realized.",
      "BARTIROMO: Do you...\n\nTRUMP: He's making a big mistake.",
      "TRUMP: I don't know what happened, but he didn't do it.",
      "When you see that, I immediately called General Mattis.",
      "TRUMP: Well, I'm going to let you figure that one out.",
      "TRUMP: Yes, I am waiting right now for so many people.",
      "But when you say reciprocal tax, nobody can get angry.",
      "Rex is doing a fantastic job, our secretary of State.",
      "Now, at the same time, I'm going to treat them great.",
      "You can't do it faster, because they're obstructing.",
      "And then they go and fight and then they have lunch.",
      "BARTIROMO: How are you on the border adjustment tax?",
      "What we are doing right now in terms of North Korea?",
      "TRUMP: — number one, you should have peace in Syria.",
      "TRUMP: The first thing I brought up was North Korea.",
      "In other words, not as simple as people would think.",
      "We were going to have a 10 or a 15 minute sit-down.",
      "Just so you understand, we're not going into Syria.",
      "So when I saw that, I said we have to do something.",
      "You know, we have...\n\nBARTIROMO: So it's in there.",
      "So I probably — I always assume no Democrat votes.",
      "(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: You don't have a lot of wires.",
      "We have thousands of jobs all across the country.",
      "TRUMP: Well, look, you know because you cover it.",
      "Statutorily, you have to go through this process.",
      "The reason is because we can't get them approved.",
      "He saved her life, because — I call it Comey won.",
      "TRUMP: When I looked, he — well, he didn't do it.",
      "And you have a tremendous power because of trade.",
      "To see an annotation, click on the yellow parts.",
      "TRUMP: But the reciprocal tax is very important.",
      "TRUMP: I haven't really wanted to talk about it.",
      "But when you say reciprocal, nobody fights you.",
      "And you look at the extent of the surveillance.",
      "So we're going to have a phenomenal tax reform.",
      "BARTIROMO: Did you get into trade and currency?",
      "They were sent back, which is a very good sign.",
      "BARTIROMO: Obama pushed...\n\nTRUMP: (INAUDIBLE).",
      "And some of the gases are unbelievably potent.",
      "And we have the best military people on Earth.",
      "It's taken a long time to get my cabinet done.",
      "The tax is 50 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent.",
      "Health care is going to happen at some point.",
      "I think we're doing very well on health care.",
      "But we talked about surveillance or whatever.",
      "Now, are we going to get involved with Syria?",
      "BARTIROMO: — do you think he's mentally fit?",
      "It's all set up with the president of China.",
      "I want to do it first to really do it right.",
      "And then you had two and then you had three.",
      "Now, look, so I don't want to put deadlines.",
      "I have friends who want to bring money back.",
      "But within there, you have certain factions.",
      "Are you looking at the — later in the year?",
      "So I don't like the term border adjustment.",
      "Is it too late now to ask him to step down?",
      "The car industry is staying in our country.",
      "Me and so many other people, it's terrible.",
      "They're hosing them down, hundreds of them.",
      "BARTIROMO: They said they got rid of them.",
      "And he got three votes from the Democrats.",
      "Now, the good thing is we have the House.",
      "It's probably $5 trillion or $4 trillion.",
      "And all of that saving goes into the tax.",
      "We've done an amazing job on regulations.",
      "And the American people know it, I think.",
      "And then he said, she was essentially OK.",
      "And he's doing a really, really good job.",
      "We are sending an armada, very powerful.",
      "Now, his father was in China four times.",
      "I'll tell you, we get along really well.",
      "And as you know, it's not even done now.",
      "We have done so much for so many people.",
      "They're not leaving anymore, believe me.",
      "BARTIROMO: Why do you think he did this?",
      "I used to see Democrats and Republicans.",
      "This is for years it's been so hostile.",
      "But Hillary Clinton won — or Comey won.",
      "TRUMP: Hundreds and hundreds of people.",
      "You know, it's going to be interesting.",
      "BARTIROMO: And you think he knows that?",
      "And then Russia came in and saved him.",
      "I mean you have — you see the backlog.",
      "BARTIROMO: Are you going to push that?",
      "This room used to have a lot of wires.",
      "We have some great people in Congress.",
      "How do you see it, when do you see it?",
      "But they kind of both go hand in hand.",
      "You have the conservative Republicans.",
      "BARTIROMO: What about infrastructure?",
      "That will be easier than health care.",
      "And I think it's very bad for Russia.",
      "And I mean we understand each other.",
      "I didn't think that was a good sign.",
      "Health care is very, very difficult.",
      "Right now, they can't bring it back.",
      "But I've been very, very political.",
      "But I have to do health care first.",
      "I mean, you know, it's just a mess.",
      "He's been — he's got a great sense.",
      "BARTIROMO: — he resisted doing it.",
      "I think it's very bad for mankind.",
      "We had a great chemistry, I think.",
      "Now it doesn't have so many wires.",
      "There's retribution if they leave.",
      "Well, not — nothing to do with me.",
      "That's a pretty hard thing to get.",
      "He should have gotten all of them.",
      "The level of hatred is incredible.",
      "BARTIROMO: Like China and [India].",
      "We have a lot of different things.",
      "So I love the idea of reciprocal.",
      "BARTIROMO: Any tax at the border?",
      "But we need close to 100 percent.",
      "Nikki Haley is doing a great job.",
      "And I joke about it a little bit.",
      "We're talking about surveillance.",
      "If you don't make them, it fails.",
      "BARTIROMO: When did you tell him?",
      "Rex is doing an outstanding job.",
      "It was a full day in Palm Beach.",
      "BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) to Syria?",
      "BARTIROMO: You're under staffed.",
      "Top of the line in every aspect.",
      "You're rolling back regulations.",
      "Take a look at Justice Gorsuch.",
      "TRUMP: Yes, they'd be together.",
      "They'd have breakfast together.",
      "Let's call it a reciprocal tax.",
      "She was guilty on every charge.",
      "I have a call tonight at 10:00.",
      "But he's doing the wrong thing.",
      "And we had meetings scheduled.",
      "But I think China can help us.",
      "He was going to be overthrown.",
      "I don't want to talk about it.",
      "TRUMP: You never know, do you?",
      "But what they did is horrible.",
      "And do you think that's smart?",
      "You'd see them at restaurants.",
      "And do you think that's fair?",
      "So it's been a lousy process.",
      "It's very bad for this world.",
      "TRUMP: I think he knows that.",
      "We had a good chemistry, yes.",
      "I really like being with him.",
      "BARTIROMO: How did he react?",
      "He is doing the wrong thing.",
      "He is doing the wrong thing.",
      "BARTIROMO: Was that planned?",
      "TRUMP: I think they know it.",
      "It was wiretapped in quotes.",
      "Let's call it an import tax.",
      "They have their own agendas.",
      "General McMaster, fantastic.",
      "And we have the White House.",
      "So ObamaCare is a disaster.",
      "I was sitting at the table.",
      "And he was eating his cake.",
      "TRUMP: It's so incredible.",
      "It lasted for three hours.",
      "TRUMP: We had the meeting.",
      "And it's not good for you.",
      "And we hit them very hard.",
      "That money is coming back.",
      "Today, you don't see that.",
      "TRUMP: Well, I think many.",
      "ObamaCare is a total mess.",
      "So we'll see what happens.",
      "We will have no Democrats.",
      "People don't realize that.",
      "We can't get them through.",
      "There was no retribution.",
      "Now, there's retribution.",
      "And they understand that.",
      "It's incredibly divisive.",
      "It's not going to matter.",
      "TRUMP: A hundred percent.",
      "So I know it's much more.",
      "There are numerous terms.",
      "They want certain things.",
      "We're now having dessert.",
      "I hope China can help us.",
      "TRUMP: He was OK with it.",
      "We were almost finished.",
      "This was during dessert.",
      "But he's over in Russia.",
      "He had nothing, nothing.",
      "They're obstructionists.",
      "We'll see what happens.",
      "They want it to happen.",
      "I have my own feelings.",

      "He was never in China.",
      "I thought he was gone.",
      "BARTIROMO: Absolutely.",
      "This is records stuff.",
      "And different things.",
      "You can't get better.",
      "It immediately fails.",
      "And that will happen.",
      "And ObamaCare failed.",
      "I told him that, yes.",
      "Heading toward Syria.",
      "BARTIROMO: Unmanned?",

      "They're all right.",
      "And it's very sad.",
      "We've freed it up.",
      "BARTIROMO: Right.",

      "The resignation came after a tumultuous week in which The New York Times revealed that Manafort's name appeared in the Ukraine ledger — although the newspaper said at the time that officials were unsure whether Manafort actually received the money — and after the AP separately reported that he had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation until 2014 on behalf of Ukraine's pro-Russian Party of Regions.",
      "The AP, however, identified in the records two payments received by Manafort that aligned with the ledger: one for $750,000 that a Ukrainian lawmaker said last month was part of a money-laundering effort that should be investigated by U.S. authorities.",
      "Manafort began discussions with the U.S. government about his lobbying activities after Trump hired him in March 2016, Maloni said, although it was unclear whether those conversations occurred before or after Trump forced Manafort to resign in August.",
      "The records of Manafort's Cypriot transactions were requested by the U.S. Treasury Department Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which works internationally with agencies to track money laundering and the movement of illicit funds around the globe.",
      "The invoice was addressed to Neocom Systems Ltd., a company formerly registered in Belize, and included the account and routing numbers and postal address for Manafort's account at a branch of Wachovia National Bank in Alexandria, Virginia.",
      "The newly obtained records also expand the global scope of Manafort's financial activities related to his Ukrainian political consulting, because both payments came from companies once registered in the Central American country of Belize.",
      "Separately, Manafort is also under scrutiny as part of congressional and FBI investigations into possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia's government under President Vladimir Putin during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.",
      "Last month, Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko revealed an invoice bearing the letterhead of Manafort's namesake company, Davis Manafort, that Leshchenko said was crafted to conceal a payment to Manafort as a purchase of 501 computers.",
      "Instead, he said Manafort's exclusive use of wire transfers for payment undermines the descriptions of the ledger last year given by Ukrainian anti-corruption authorities and a lawmaker that the ledger detailed cash payments.",
      "Now, financial records newly obtained by The Associated Press confirm that at least $1.2 million in payments listed in the ledger next to Manafort's name were actually received by his consulting firm in the United States.",
      "Leshchenko said last month the 2009 invoice was one of about 50 pages of documents, including private paperwork and copies of employee-issued debit cards, that were found in Manafort's former Kiev office by a new tenant.",
      "In a statement to the AP on Tuesday, Manafort did not deny that his firm received the money but said \"any wire transactions received by my company are legitimate payments for political consulting work that was provided.",
      "On Wednesday, Manafort's spokesman Jason Maloni provided an additional statement to the AP, saying that Manafort received all of his payments via wire transfers conducted through the international banking system.",
      "The payments detailed in the ledger and confirmed by the documents obtained by the AP are unrelated to the 2016 presidential campaign and came years before Manafort worked as Trump's unpaid campaign chairman.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been looking into Manafort's work for years as part of an effort to recover Ukrainian assets stolen after the 2014 ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia.",
      "Also Wednesday, one of the Washington lobbying firms involved in that covert campaign, the Podesta Group Inc., formally registered with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.",
      "The AP had previously been unable to independently verify the $750,000 payment went to a Manafort company, but the newly obtained financial records reflect Manafort's receipt of that payment.",
      "Maloni accused Leshchenko on Wednesday of changing his story, saying Leshchenko had previously said the ledger detailed cash payments but now said that wire transfers support his allegations.",
      "In an interview with the AP, Leshchenko contended that Yanukovych, as Ukraine's leader, paid Manafort money that came from his government's budget and was \"stolen from Ukrainian citizens.\"",
      "\"What is clear, however, is individuals with political motivations are taking disparate pieces of information and distorting their significance through a campaign of smear and innuendo.\"",
      "Manafort told the AP that he was unable to review his own banking records showing receipt of the payments because his bank destroyed the records after a standard 7-year retention period.",
      "Ukrainian investigators called it evidence of off-the-books payments from a pro-Russian political party — and part of a larger pattern of corruption under the country's former president.",
      "WASHINGTON (AP) — Last August, a handwritten ledger surfaced in Ukraine with dollar amounts and dates next to the name of Paul Manafort, who was then Donald Trump's campaign chairman.",
      "\"There is absolutely nothing improper with this method of payment and there is no basis to give any credibility to the current Leshchenko allegations to the contrary,\" Maloni said.",
      "They also put the ledger in a new light, as federal prosecutors in the U.S. have been investigating Manafort's work in Eastern Europe as part of a larger anti-corruption probe.",
      "On Wednesday, Maloni told the AP that Manafort intends to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for work he did on behalf of political interests in Ukraine.",
      "In December, the bureau accused Mykhaylo Okhendovsky of receiving more than $160,000 from Party of Regions officials in 2012, when he was Ukraine's main election official.",
      "The amount of the invoice — $750,000— and the payment date of Oct. 14, 2009, matches one entry on the ledger indicating payments to Manafort from the Party of Regions.",
      "Previously, Manafort and Maloni have maintained the ledger was fabricated and said no public evidence existed that Manafort or others received payments recorded in it.",
      "The anti-corruption bureau, which has been looking into the Black Ledger, publicly confirmed the authenticity of the signature of one top official mentioned there.",
      "Last month, the AP reported that the U.S. government has examined Manafort's financial transactions in the Mediterranean country of Cyprus as part of its probe.",
      "By registering retroactively, Manafort will be acknowledging that he failed to properly disclose his work to the Justice Department as required by federal law.",
      "Officials with the Ukrainian National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is investigating corruption under Yanukovych, have said they believe the ledger is genuine.",
      "They include payments in 2007 and 2009, providing the first evidence that Manafort's firm received at least some money listed in the so-called Black Ledger.",
      "The firm, run by the brother of Hillary Clinton presidential campaign chairman John Podesta, reported being paid more than $1.2 million for its efforts.",
      "It cited unspecified \"information brought to light in recent months\" and conversations with Justice Department employees as the reason for its decision.",
      "Manafort, a longtime Republican political operative, led the presidential campaign from March until August last year when Trump asked him to resign.",
      "The two payments came years before Manafort became involved in Trump's campaign, but for the first time bolster the credibility of the ledger.",
      "\"Mr. Manafort's work in Ukraine was totally open and appropriate, and wire transfers for international work are perfectly legal,\" Maloni said.",
      "Manafort has recently been given guidance by federal authorities related to whether he should register as a foreign agent, Maloni said.",
      "Manafort, who worked for the party as an international political consultant, has publicly questioned the ledger's authenticity.",
      "But they have previously noted that they have no way of knowing whether Manafort received the money listed next to his name.",
      "___\n\nAssociated Press writers Nataliya Vasilyeva contributed reporting from Kiev and Moscow, and Lynn Berry from Washington.",
      "Maloni said Leshchenko's allegations were politically motivated because Manafort once supported an opposing political party.",
      "Leshchenko said U.S. authorities should investigate what he described as corrupt deals between Manafort and Yanukovych.",
      "The AP provided to Manafort the amounts of the payments, dates and number of the bank account where they were received.",
      "Manafort noted that he agreed to be paid according to his \"clients' preferred financial institutions and instructions.\"",
      "The records show that Davis Manafort received the amount from Neocom Systems the day after the date of the invoice.",
      "As the AP reported last month, U.S. authorities have been looking into Manafort's financial transactions in Cyprus.",
      "In doing so, it acknowledged that its work at the time could have principally benefited the Ukrainian government.",
      "The other firm, Mercury LLC, later said it also will register as a foreign agent over its work on the campaign.",
      "Asked by the AP whether Manafort intends to register as a foreign agent, Maloni said, \"Yes, he is registering.\"",
      "Dozens of Ukrainian political figures mentioned in the Black Ledger are under investigation in Ukraine.",
      "The bureau said it is not investigating Manafort because he is not a Ukrainian citizen.",

      "The assessment concluded with high confidence that the Kremlin ordered an extensive, multi-pronged propaganda effort “to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.”\n\nThat review did not attempt to assess what effect the Russian efforts had on the election, despite the fact that “Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards.” According to the Department of Homeland Security, the assessment reported reassuringly, “the types of systems we observed Russian actors targeting or compromising are not involved in vote tallying.”\n\nThe NSA has now learned, however, that Russian government hackers, part of a team with a “cyber espionage mandate specifically directed at U.S. and foreign elections,” focused on parts of the system directly connected to the voter registration process, including a private sector manufacturer of devices that maintain and verify the voter rolls.",
      "The NSA assessed that this phase of the spear-fishing operation was likely launched on either October 31 or November 1 and sent spear-fishing emails to 122 email addresses “associated with named local government organizations,” probably to officials “involved in the management of voter registration systems.” The emails contained Microsoft Word attachments purporting to be benign documentation for VR Systems’ EViD voter database product line, but which were in reality maliciously embedded with automated software commands that are triggered instantly and invisibly when the user opens the document.",
      "“This could affect whether someone has the ability to cast a regular ballot, or be required to cast a ‘provisional’ ballot — which would mean it has to be checked for their eligibility before it is included in the vote, and it may mean the voter has to jump through certain hoops such as proving their information to the election official before their eligibility is affirmed.”\n\nMark Graff, a digital security consultant and former chief cybersecurity officer at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, described such a hypothetical tactic as “effectively a denial of service attack” against would-be voters.",
      "“Once the user opens up that email [attachment],” Williams explained, “the attacker has all the same capabilities that the user does.” Vikram Thakur, a senior research manager at Symantec’s Security Response Team, told The Intercept that in cases like this the “quantity of exfiltrated data is only limited by the controls put in place by network administrators.” Data theft of this variety is typically encrypted, meaning anyone observing an infected network wouldn’t be able to see what exactly was being removed but should certainly be able to tell something was afoot, Williams added.",
      "If opened, the files “very likely” would have instructed the infected computer to begin downloading in the background a second package of malware from a remote server also controlled by the hackers, which the secret report says could have provided attackers with “persistent access” to the computer or the ability to “survey the victims for items of interest.” Essentially, the weaponized Word document quietly unlocks and opens a target’s back door, allowing virtually any cocktail of malware to be subsequently delivered automatically.",
      "Two months later, on October 27, they set up an “operational” Gmail account designed to appear as if it belonged to an employee at VR Systems, and used documents obtained from the previous operation to launch a second spear-phishing operation “targeting U.S. local government organizations.” These emails contained a Microsoft Word document that had been “trojanized” so that when it was opened it would send out a beacon to the “malicious infrastructure” set up by the hackers.",
      "This NSA summary judgment is sharply at odds with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denial last week that Russia had interfered in foreign elections: “We never engaged in that on a state level, and have no intention of doing so.” Putin, who had previously issued blanket denials that any such Russian meddling occurred, for the first time floated the possibility that freelance Russian hackers with “patriotic leanings” may have been responsible.",
      "It states unequivocally in its summary statement that it was Russian military intelligence, specifically the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, that conducted the cyber attacks described in the document:\n\nThe NSA analysis does not draw conclusions about whether the interference had any effect on the election’s outcome and concedes that much remains unknown about the extent of the hackers’ accomplishments.",
      "“It appears to be user errors at different points in the process, between the setup of the computers and the poll workers using them.”\n\nAll of this taken together ratchets up the stakes of the ongoing investigations into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives, which promises to soak up more national attention this week as fired FBI Director James Comey appears before Congress to testify.",
      "“The problem we have is that voting security doesn’t matter until something happens, and then after something happens, there’s a group of people who don’t want the security, because whatever happened, happened in their favor,” said Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert at Harvard’s Berkman Center who has written frequently about the security vulnerabilities of U.S. election systems.",
      "Vendors like VR are also particularly sensitive, according to Norden, because local election offices “are often unlikely to have many or even any IT staff,” meaning “a vendor like this will also provide most of the IT assistance, including the work related to programming and cyber security”—not the kind of people you want unwittingly compromised by a hostile nation state.",
      "“You could even do that preferentially in areas for voters that are likely to vote for a certain candidate and thereby have a partisan effect.”\n\nUsing this method to target a U.S. presidential election, the Russian approach faces a challenge in the decentralized federal election system, where processes differ not merely state to state but often county to county.",
      "According to Alex Halderman, director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society and an electronic voting expert, one of the main concerns in the scenario described by the NSA document is the likelihood that the officials setting up the electronic poll books are the same people doing the pre-programming of the voting machines.",
      "The NSA notes in its report that it is “unknown whether the aforementioned spear-phishing deployment successfully compromised all the intended victims, and what potential data from the victim could have been exfiltrated.”\n\nVR Systems declined to respond to a request for comment on the specific hacking operation outlined in the NSA document.",
      "In one, Russian military hackers created an email account pretending to be another U.S. election company, referred to in the document as U.S. company 2, from which they sent fake test emails offering “election-related products and services.” The agency was unable to determine whether there was any targeting using this account.",
      "“It is unknown,” the NSA notes, “whether the aforementioned spear-phishing deployment successfully compromised the intended victims, and what potential data could have been accessed by the cyber actor.”\n\nThe FBI would not comment about whether it is pursuing a criminal investigation into the cyber attack on VR Systems.",
      "Graphic: NSA\n\nThe Spear-Phishing Attack\n\nAs described by the classified NSA report, the Russian plan was simple: pose as an e-voting vendor and trick local government employees into opening Microsoft Word documents invisibly tainted with potent malware that could give hackers full control over the infected computers.",
      "It is unclear what the effort achieved, but the NSA assessed that the Russians appeared intent on “mimicking a legitimate absentee ballot-related service provider.” The report does not indicate why the Russians targeted the tiny Pacific islands, a U.S. territory with no electoral votes to contribute to the election.",
      "The top-secret National Security Agency document, which was provided anonymously to The Intercept and independently authenticated, analyzes intelligence very recently acquired by the agency about a months-long Russian intelligence cyber effort against elements of the U.S. election and voting infrastructure.",
      "Russian military intelligence executed a cyberattack on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and sent spear-phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials just days before last November’s presidential election, according to a highly classified intelligence report obtained by The Intercept.",
      "Any potential risks or vulnerabilities are being monitored, and this agency works with the Department of Homeland Security and the N.C. Department of Information Technology to help mitigate any potential risks,” said Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the North Carolina board of elections.",
      "“If you look at the last few elections, 2000 was decided in Florida, 2004 in Ohio, the most recent election in a couple counties in Michigan and Pennsylvania, so deciding exactly where to hack is really hard to know.”\n\nBut the system’s decentralization is also a vulnerability.",
      "To the extent the elections are vulnerable to hacking, we risk the legitimacy of the voting process, even if there is no actual hacking at the time.”\n\nThroughout history, the transfer of power has been the moment of greatest weakness for societies, leading to untold bloodshed.",
      "An attempt to directly break into or alter the actual voting machines would be more conspicuous and considerably riskier than compromising an adjacent, less visible part of the voting system, like voter registration databases, in the hope that one is networked to the other.",
      "“Once you get a beachhead, then you try to figure out how to go elsewhere.”\n\nAll of this means that it is critical to understand just how integral VR Systems is to our election system, and what exactly the implications of this breach are for the integrity of the result.",
      "“Once you do that, you can cause the voting machine to create fraudulent counts.”\n\nAccording to Schneier, a major prize in breaching VR Systems would be the ability to gather enough information to effectively execute spoof attacks against election officials themselves.",
      "Sure enough, VR Systems advertises the fact that its EViD computer polling station equipment line is connected to the internet, and that on Election Day “a voter’s voting history is transmitted immediately to the county database” on a continuous basis.",
      "“I would worry about whether an attacker who could compromise the poll book vendor might be able to use software updates that the vendor distributes to also infect the election management system that programs the voting machines themselves,” he added.",
      "“So in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn’t happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn’t.",
      "If collusion can ultimately be demonstrated — a big if at this point — then the assistance on Russia’s part went beyond allegedly hacking email to serve a propaganda campaign, and bled into an attack on U.S. election infrastructure itself.",
      "Although the document does not directly identify the company in question, it contains references to a product made by VR Systems, a Florida-based vendor of electronic voting services and equipment whose products are used in eight states.",
      "One U.S. intelligence official conceded that the Russian operation outlined by the NSA — targeting voter registration software — could potentially have disrupted voting in the locations where VR Systems’ products were being used.",
      "Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate actors … executed cyber espionage operations against a named U.S. company in August 2016, evidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions.",
      "These particular weaponized files used PowerShell, a Microsoft scripting language designed for system administrators and installed by default on Windows computers, allowing vast control over a system’s settings and functions.",
      "Pamela Smith, president of election integrity watchdog Verified Voting, agreed that even if VR Systems doesn’t facilitate the actual casting of votes, it could make an alluring target for anyone hoping to disrupt the vote.",
      "In a third Russian operation, the same group of hackers sent test emails to addresses at the American Samoa Election Office, presumably to determine whether those accounts existed before launching another phishing attack.",
      "The actual voting machines aren’t going to be networked to something like VR Systems’ EViD, but they do receive manual updates and configuration from people at the local or state level who could be responsible for both.",
      "Companies like VR are “very important” because “a functioning registration system is central to American elections,” explained Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.",
      "Christian Hilland, a spokesperson for the FEC, told The Intercept that “the Federal Election Commission does not have jurisdiction over voting matters as well as software and hardware in connection with casting votes.",
      "VR Systems doesn’t sell the actual touchscreen machines used to cast a vote, but rather the software and devices that verify and catalogue who’s permitted to vote when they show up on Election Day or for early voting.",
      "Overall, the method is one of “medium sophistication,” Williams said, one that “practically any hacker can pull off.”\n\nThe NSA, however, is uncertain about the results of the attack, according to the report.",
      "“I’ll take credentials most days over malware,” he said, since an employee’s login information can be used to penetrate “corporate VPNs, email, or cloud services,” allowing access to internal corporate data.",
      "Jake Williams, founder of computer security firm Rendition Infosec and formerly of the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations hacking team, said stolen logins can be even more dangerous than an infected computer.",
      "The registration system malfunctioned at a number of polling locations, causing chaos and long lines, which triggered election officials to switch to paper ballots and extend voting later into the evening.",
      "“What I was concerned about in particular was making sure [the DNC hack] wasn’t compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting, affect the actual election process itself,” Obama said.",
      "Whatever the investigation into the Trump campaign concludes, however, it pales in comparison to the threat posed to the legitimacy of U.S. elections if the infrastructure itself can’t be secured.",
      "The report adds significant new detail to the picture that emerged from the unclassified intelligence assessment about Russian election meddling released by the Obama administration in January.",
      "While the document provides a rare window into the NSA’s understanding of the mechanics of Russian hacking, it does not show the underlying “raw” intelligence on which the analysis is based.",
      "“It’s not just that [an election] has to be fair, it has to be demonstrably fair, so that the loser says, ‘Yep, I lost fair and square.’ If you can’t do that, you’re screwed,” said Schneier.",
      "Attached to the secret NSA report is an overview chart detailing the Russian government’s spear-phishing operation, apparently missing a second page that was not provided to The Intercept.",
      "Phishing, as the name implies, doesn’t require everyone to take the bait in order to be a success — though Williams stressed that hackers “never want just one” set of stolen credentials.",
      "The spear-phishing email contained a link directing the employees to a malicious, faux-Google website that would request their login credentials and then hand them over to the hackers.",
      "Chief Operating Officer Ben Martin replied by email to The Intercept’s request for comment with the following statement:\n\nPhishing and spear-phishing are not uncommon in our industry.",
      "While malicious emails targeting three of the potential victims were rejected by an email server, at least one of the employee accounts was likely compromised, the agency concluded.",
      "Although the NSA report indicates that VR Systems was targeted only with login-stealing trickery, rather than computer-controlling malware, this isn’t necessarily a reassuring sign.",
      "Some of the company’s devices are advertised as having wireless internet and Bluetooth connectivity, which could have provided an ideal staging point for further malicious actions.",
      "So on August 24, 2016, the Russian hackers sent spoofed emails purporting to be from Google to employees of an unnamed U.S. election software company, according to the NSA report.",
      "A U.S. intelligence officer who declined to be identified cautioned against drawing too big a conclusion from the document because a single analysis is not necessarily definitive.",
      "The January assessment presented the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusions but omitted many specifics, citing concerns about disclosing sensitive sources and methods.",
      "… The actors likely used data obtained from that operation to … launch a voter registration-themed spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations.",
      "However, the report raises the possibility that Russian hacking may have breached at least some elements of the voting system, with disconcertingly uncertain results.",
      "According to its website, VR Systems has contracts in eight states: California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.",
      "The NSA conclusion “demonstrates that countries are looking at specific tactics for election manipulation, and we need to be vigilant in defense,” said Schneier.",
      "“The N.C. State Board of Elections did not experience any suspicious activity during the 2016 election outside of what this agency experiences at other times.",
      "At a December press conference, President Obama said that he told Russian President Vladimir Putin in September not to hack the U.S. election infrastructure.",
      "We regularly participate in cyber alliances with state officials and members of the law enforcement community in an effort to address these types of threats.",
      "But in order to dupe the local officials, the hackers needed access to an election software vendor’s internal systems to put together a convincing disguise.",
      "But a more worrying prospect, according to Graff, is that hackers would target a company like VR Systems to get closer to the actual tabulation of the vote.",
      "“Usually at the county level there’s going to be some company that does the pre-election programming of the voting machines,” Halderman told The Intercept.",
      "“That makes it a very hard security problem, unlike your bank account.”\n\nSchneier said the attack, as described by the NSA, is standard hacking procedure.",
      "“Hacking an election is hard, not because of technology — that’s surprisingly easy — but it’s hard to know what’s going to be effective,” said Schneier.",
      "If there were a central U.S. election authority, it might have launched an investigation into what happened in Durham, North Carolina, on Election Day.",
      "According to Williams, if this type of attack were successful, the perpetrator would possess “unlimited” capacity for siphoning away items of interest.",
      "Photo: Ty Wright/Getty Images\n\nAn Alluring Target\n\nGetting attention and a budget commitment to election security requires solving a political riddle.",
      "The Intercept agreed to some of the redaction requests after determining that the disclosure of that material was not clearly in the public interest.",
      "But you needed a commitment of budget and attention.”\n\nThe NSA document briefly describes two other election-related Russian hacking operations.",
      "The report, dated May 5, 2017, is the most detailed U.S. government account of Russian interference in the election that has yet come to light.",
      "“There was some investigation there, essentially no evidence came out of it indicating there was any problem with the product,” he said.",
      "“The fact that this is occurring in October is troubling,” said one senior law enforcement official with significant cyber expertise.",
      "Durham’s voter rolls were run by VR Systems — the same firm that was compromised by the Russian hack, according to the NSA document.",
      "“If someone has access to a state voter database, they can take malicious action by modifying or removing information,” she said.",
      "A computer attack can thus spread quickly and invisibly through networked components of a system like germs through a handshake.",
      "EAC also accredits testing laboratories and certifies voting systems,” but it is a backwater commission with no real authority.",
      "And in fact we did not see further tampering of the election process.”\n\nYet the NSA has now found that the tampering continued.",
      "The report indicates that Russian hacking may have penetrated further into U.S. voting systems than was previously understood.",
      "You may want to check with the Election Assistance Commission.”\n\nChecking with the EAC is also less than confidence inspiring.",
      "George McCue, deputy director of the Durham County board of elections, also said that VR Systems’ software was not the issue.",
      "The EAC notes online that it “is charged with serving as a national clearinghouse of information on election administration.",
      "There is no strong central government oversight of the election process or the acquisition of voting hardware or software.",
      "Likewise, voter registration, maintenance of voter rolls, and vote counting lack any effective national oversight.",

      "Officials requested that we not publish or report on the top secret document and declined to comment on it.",
      "The risk is particularly heightened given how common it is to use the same password for multiple services.",

      "Rosenstein assured House members that the Justice Department would work with members of Congress “to coordinate our parallel efforts” and establish a point of contact for Mueller.",
      "He’s good, he’s solid but he’s also a survivor and you don’t survive that long without making some compromises and I’m concerned about that,” according to the Times account.",
      "But Democrats, in particular, left the meeting frustrated that Rosenstein was not more forthcoming with information about Trump’s decision to fire Comey.",
      "But Comey did not completely agree with his friend, Ben Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the editor in chief of the Lawfare blog.",
      "But Rosenstein, who was only recently confirmed as the Justice Department’s second-highest ranking official, left no doubt that it was voluntary.",
      "I stand by it.”\n\n“Notwithstanding my personal affection for Director Comey, I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader,” Rosenstein said.",
      "Several lawmakers have expressed concerns that the new special counsel investigation may impede the congressional investigations.",
      "“Moreover,” he said, “I consulted my staff and acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, and none of them recalls such a request.”",
      "“My memorandum is not a legal brief; these are not issues of law,” said Rosenstein, a longtime federal prosecutor.",
      "Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.) described the meeting as a “brief presentation followed by a Q and A.",

      "I mean, I want whoever the director is, I want him to do the right thing.",
      "I will tell you, I think that -- I want very simply a great FBI director.",
      "And I think frankly, it's -- I assume he's going to give the letter out.",
      "I said if it's possible, would you let me know am I under investigation.",

      "HOLT: Monday you met with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.",
      "There is no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians.",
      "And his -- and -- and this is something they never want to report.",
      "TRUMP: Yeah, but everything plays in -- everything plays into it.",
      "I had the Miss Universe pageant, which I owned for quite a while.",
      "When I did this now, I said I probably maybe will confuse people.",
      "But I said to myself I might even lengthen out the investigation.",
      "HOLT: Let me ask you about your termination letter to Mr. Comey.",
      "HOLT: General Flynn is a part of this investigation as you know.",
      "And we ultimately fired -- but we fired for a different reason.",
      "TRUMP: I think that -- about the Hillary Clinton investigation?",
      "TRUMP: Oh, I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.",
      "It's very hard because you start off at such a disadvantage.",
      "Now, what do I -- should I say no, I'm not going to see him?",
      "So, everybody was thinking they should've won the election.",
      "TRUMP: In one case I called him and one case he called me.",
      "One day you meet on the issue of Comey...\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Right.",
      "I built a great company, but I'm not involved with Russia.",
      "Did you think through the optics of a way this would look?",
      "TRUMP: I never thought about -- it was set up a while ago.",
      "I think it's really a good thing that I meet with people.",
      "HOLT: Any -- any surrogates on behalf of the White House?",
      "I also want to have a really competent, capable director.",
      "But I have to do the right thing for the American people.",
      "TRUMP: ...I've heard that -- I've heard that from others.",
      "The other thing is the Russians did not affect the vote.",
      "HOLT: Because -- because of lying to the vice president.",
      "Now...\n\n\n\nHOLT: The acting Attorney General at the time.",
      "HOLT: ...received payments from the Turkish government?",
      "There's a big thing going on right now which is spying.",
      "TRUMP: I was surprised he said it, but I wasn't angry.",
      "But I want to find out -- I want to get to the bottom.",
      "HOLT: Did anyone from the White House...\n\n\n\nTRUMP: No.",
      "He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on.",
      "But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia.",
      "Well, this was announced that I'm meeting with Lavrov.",
      "HOLT: But when you put out tweets it's a total hoax.",
      "And I want to make sure it will never, ever happen.",
      "But I want somebody who's going to do a great job.",
      "You know that, I know that, everybody knows that.",
      "So, I'm -- I'm OK with those discussions, Lester.",
      "I have no investments in Russia, none whatsoever.",
      "And it's -- you can scroll to anything you want.",
      "Or by the way any -- but -- any -- anybody else.",
      "HOLT: Did you ask him to drop the investigation?",
      "You were the centerpiece of the Trump campaign.",
      "HOLT: And did you ask am I under investigation?",
      "And then, during another phone call he said it.",
      "I -- there's no good time to do it, by the way.",
      "TRUMP: What I did is I was going to fire Comey.",
      "This was an excuse for having lost an election.",
      "It was 18 days later that he was finally fired.",
      "I'm looking to do a great job for the country.",
      "TRUMP: I just want somebody that's competent.",
      "HOLT: So, that didn't come directly from him.",
      "TRUMP: Then, during a phone call, he said it.",
      "And I want that to be so strong and so good.",
      "I'm looking to create strength and security.",
      "But it says: \"I am not involved in Russia.\"",
      "I think it's a good thing, not a bad thing.",
      "HOLT: And one last question on this matter.",
      "I think...\n\n\n\nHOLT: Was it in a phone call?",
      "He's a, in my opinion, a very good person.",
      "And to me, that's the big story right now.",
      "HOLT: You're talking about General Flynn?",
      "TRUMP: My White House counsel came to me.",
      "And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head.",
      "I think that we have to get back to work.",
      "He said you are not under investigation.",
      "When was the -- when was the other two?",
      "HOLT: him taking up that investigation?",
      "HOLT: Did you ask for a recommendation?",
      "TRUMP: I -- I was going to fire Comey.",
      "He's the wrong man for that position.",
      "I don't know that I knew him in 2015.",
      "You know, you're talking about 2015.",
      "And I said I'll, you know, consider.",

      "I'm looking for things like that.",
      "But what difference does it make?",
      "I have to speak with Putin also.",
      "I don't have property in Russia.",
      "I'm not talking about campaigns.",

      "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nBut questions were raised about President Trump’s account of when he learned about the meeting, in light of a statement he made on June 7, 2016 — before the meeting, but after the email exchanges with Donald Jr. On that day, Trump promised a major address the following week that he said would describe Clinton’s “corrupt dealings” to give “favorable treatment” to foreign governments, including “the Russians.” White House officials have said the timing of Trump’s statement was a coincidence and that his promised address about the Clintons was postponed when, a few days later, an Islamic State-inspired security guard went on a rampage at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., killing 49 people.",
      "The exchange apparently was initiated on June 3, 2016, when a Trump family associate, publicist Rob Goldstone, emailed Donald Jr. with an offer of something “very interesting” … “official documents and information” that “would be very useful to your father.” On June 8, 2016, Trump Jr. forwarded an email to Kushner and Manafort about the upcoming meeting with the subject line: “FW: Russia-Clinton-private & confidential.” Trump Jr. wrote back later that day, telling Goldstone “if it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”\n\nThe discovery of the emails prompted Kushner to amend his security clearance form to reflect the meeting, which he had failed to report when he originally sought clearance for his White House job.",
      "Trump told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that he learned just “a couple of days ago” that Donald Jr. had met with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, hoping to receive information that “would incriminate Hillary” and was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” A day earlier, on Tuesday, Donald Jr. released the email exchanges himself, after learning they would be published by the New York Times.",
      "President Trump and son Donald Trump Jr. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Alex Brandon/AP, Matt York/AP)\n\nWASHINGTON — President Trump’s legal team was informed more than three weeks ago about the email chain arranging a June 2016 meeting between his son Donald Jr. and a Kremlin-connected lawyer, two sources familiar with the handling of the matter told Yahoo News.",
      "But the sources told Yahoo News that Marc Kasowitz, the president’s chief lawyer in the Russia investigation, and Alan Garten, executive vice president and chief legal officer of the Trump Organization, were both informed about the emails in the third week of June, after they were discovered by lawyers for Kushner, who is now a senior White House official.",
      "This was followed by a revised security clearance submission on May 11 in which Kushner reported more than 100 meetings with officials from over 20 countries, including a meeting with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and another with Sergey Gorkov, head of a Russian state-owned bank.",
      "“I only heard about it two or three days ago,” he said, according to a transcript of his talk, when asked about the meeting with Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in June 2016 attended by Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, then Trump’s campaign chief, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Richard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush told Yahoo News Thursday night that he finds it “weird” and “unbelievable” that Trump’s lawyers would not have informed the president about a matter so sensitive relating to the Russia investigation.",
      "The next day, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview that the meeting was a “big nothing burger.”\n\nThe president himself repeatedly described the Russia investigation as “fake news” and ridiculed television networks’ reports about it.",
      "Pushing back the discovery of the emails to the third week in June also raises additional questions about the initial public statements made by the White House after the existence of the meeting was first reported by the New York Times on July 8.",
      "At that time, Trump Jr. issued a public statement describing the session as a “short introductory meeting” in which the primary topic of discussion was “the adoption of Russian children” by American families.",
      "Kushner made the change even though there were questions among his lawyers whether the meeting had to be reported, given that there was no clear evidence that Veselnitskaya was a government official.",
      "His lawyers are confident that it won’t raise any additional problems since, as they have asserted, Kushner had forgotten the meeting — he was only briefly present — and had no intent to conceal it.",
      "The actual purpose of the meeting, to obtain damaging information about Hillary Clinton ostensibly collected by the Russian government, wasn’t mentioned in Trump’s initial statement.",
      "The change to the security form prompted the FBI to question Kushner on June 23, the second time he was interviewed by agents about his security clearance, the sources said.",
      "Aside from questions about the credibility of White House statements, the disclosure of the emails potentially has raised new questions about Kushner’s security clearance.",
      "With 4 months looking at Russia… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n..under a magnifying glass, they have zero \"tapes\" of T people colluding.",
      "But the information that Trump’s lawyers were told about the emails in June raises questions about why they would not have immediately informed the president.",
      "A spokesman for Kasowitz declined to comment, saying the matter involved “privileged information.” Garten did not respond to an email request for comment.",
      "He initially filed his SF-86 on Jan. 18, leaving out any mention of meetings with foreign government officials during the transition and the campaign.",
      "His lawyers have said this was inadvertent and that a member of his staff had prematurely hit the “send” button for the form before it was completed.",
      "Within twelve hours, they have said, Kushner notified the FBI that he would make amendments and disclose his meetings with foreign officials.",
      "Trump’s campaign is under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion with Russian government officials.",
      "The bureau is now reviewing Kushner’s second amended form following the new disclosure about his meeting with the Russian lawyer.",
      "The emails appear to be the first hard evidence of contacts between top campaign officials and someone connected to the Kremlin.",
      "“You have a professional obligation to inform the client about information that he needs to make informed decisions,” he said.",
      "That would be especially true for a client “who feels the need to comment on every last thing in the world,” he added.",
      "The revised security clearance led to Kushner’s first FBI interview about the matter in mid-May, the sources said.",
      "“With four months looking at Russia … under a magnifying glass, they have ‘zero tapes’ of T people colluding.",
      "Trump repeated that assertion in a talk with reporters on Air Force One on his way to Paris Wednesday night.",
      "The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling.",
      "I should be given apology!” the president wrote in two tweets on June 26.",
      "That revision — his second — to the so-called SF-86, was done on June 21.",
      "In the meantime, he has an interim security clearance, sources said.",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nBut questions were raised about President Trump’s account of when he learned about the meeting, in light of a statement he made on June 7, 2016 — before the meeting, but after the email exchanges with Donald Jr. On that day, Trump promised a major address the following week that he said would describe Clinton’s “corrupt dealings” to give “favorable treatment” to foreign governments, including “the Russians.” White House officials have said the timing of Trump’s statement was a coincidence and that his promised address about the Clintons was postponed when, a few days later, an Islamic State-inspired security guard went on a rampage at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., killing 49 people.",
      "The exchange apparently was initiated on June 3, 2016, when a Trump family associate, publicist Rob Goldstone, emailed Donald Jr. with an offer of something “very interesting” … “official documents and information” that “would be very useful to your father.” On June 8, 2016, Trump Jr. forwarded an email to Kushner and Manafort about the upcoming meeting with the subject line: “FW: Russia-Clinton-private & confidential.” Trump Jr. wrote back later that day, telling Goldstone “if it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”\n\nThe discovery of the emails prompted Kushner to amend his security clearance form to reflect the meeting, which he had failed to report when he originally sought clearance for his White House job.",
      "Trump told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that he learned just “a couple of days ago” that Donald Jr. had met with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, hoping to receive information that “would incriminate Hillary” and was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” A day earlier, on Tuesday, Donald Jr. released the email exchanges himself, after learning they would be published by the New York Times.",

      "But the sources told Yahoo News that Marc Kasowitz, the president’s chief lawyer in the Russia investigation, and Alan Garten, executive vice president and chief legal officer of the Trump Organization, were both informed about the emails in the third week of June, after they were discovered by lawyers for Kushner, who is now a senior White House official.",
      "This was followed by a revised security clearance submission on May 11 in which Kushner reported more than 100 meetings with officials from over 20 countries, including a meeting with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and another with Sergey Gorkov, head of a Russian state-owned bank.",
      "“I only heard about it two or three days ago,” he said, according to a transcript of his talk, when asked about the meeting with Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in June 2016 attended by Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, then Trump’s campaign chief, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.",

      "And how your responses morphed from, 'I did not have communications with the Russians' to 'I did not discuss substantive, I did not discuss the political campaign' and then finally going to, 'I did not discuss interference in the election.",
      "Sessions also read at length from the transcript of his confirmation hearing and Franken's original question, which referred to a CNN report about the Trump dossier that he said at the time he did not expect Sessions would have yet seen.",
      "In an awkward follow-up exchange later with Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Democrat pressed Sessions on whether he or his office had been asked for an interview, with Sessions smiling wanly as he avoided giving a firm answer.",
      "\"Let me just say, without hesitation, that I conducted no improper discussions with Russians at any time regarding a campaign or any other item facing this country,\" Sessions tried to begin his answer, before an aside about time.",
      "Russia comes up again\n\nSessions' meetings with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign came up quickly during the hearing, and was the subject of multiple testy exchanges with his former colleagues on the committee.",
      "During the nearly five-hour hearing that touched on topics including Russian election meddling, immigration and criminal justice reform, Sessions also debated executive privilege with committee Democrats.",
      "\"My concern is you were part of the Russian facade and went along with it,\" Vermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy said after a second round of tense questioning as the hearing stretched into the afternoon.",
      "\"You answered emphatically, no,\" Leahy said, noting that after Sessions' confirmation it was revealed by the press that Sessions had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on multiple occasions.",
      "In a back and forth that included repeated asides about time remaining and pleas to the chairman for fairness, Sessions took umbrage at Franken's implication that he had acted improperly.",
      "\"It is well established that the President is entitled to have private, confidential conversations with his Cabinet officials ... such communications are the core of executive privilege.\"",
      "He asked Sessions anew whether he had discussed with Russian officials emails, interference in the election, sanctions and the Magnitsky Act, and Trump's policies with Russian officials.",
      "Chairman Chuck Grassley backed up Sessions after several rounds of such questions, saying former Attorney General Eric Holder had made similar claims during the Obama administration.",
      "Leahy said that as a senator, Sessions \"wouldn't tolerate being misled\" and asked him if he could \"understand\" the impression of Democrats that his answer was \"false testimony.\"",
      "\"I believe my answer was correct,\" Sessions said, pulling out the questionnaire and reading from the lead-up to the question, which referenced interference in the 2016 campaign.",
      "When it became Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse's turn to ask questions, he cut the tension with humor and apologized for a distraction during the previous exchange.",
      "Heated exchange with Franken\n\nFranken picked up on the exchange, and pressed Sessions on his answers to the Democrat's own questions during the confirmation hearing.",
      "Leahy and Sessions went back and forth for several minutes, with Leahy noting that both men were lawyers and know the difference between \"no\" and \"I don't recall.\"",
      "\"The executive branch is a co-equal branch and you would not want someone demanding to know who you talked to in your office, your counsel, your chief of staff.",
      "\"I've committed myself to a high level of public service, to reach the highest level of standards and decency in my public service,\" Sessions told Franken.",
      "Sessions was asked by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, about whether the President could pre-emptively pardon a person under investigation.",
      "\"I can neither assert executive privilege neither can I disclose today the contents of my confidential conversations with the President,\" Sessions said.",
      "\"Not being able to recall what you discussed with him is very different than saying, 'I have not had communications with the Russians,'\" Franken said.",
      "Leahy pressed Sessions on whether he had been interviewed by Mueller, not allowing Sessions to demur to ask the special counsel about it first.",
      "\"The FBI did not do that and now we have conflicts I think could have been avoided if the FBI would have been more transparent,\" Grassley said.",
      "\"You answered no, you concealed your own contact with Russian officials at a time when such contacts were of great interest to the committee.\"",
      "Sessions also grew visibly uncomfortable when Leahy asked him about his interactions with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.",
      "Neither would we want to be prowling willy-nilly through the Supreme Court and what their clerks knew or were told,\" Sessions said.",
      "\"I took that to mean, not any casual conversation, but did I participate with the Russians about the 2016 election,\" Sessions said.",
      "Sessions and Leahy went through each, with Sessions giving answers from \"I don't recall having done any such thing\" to a flat \"no.\"",
      "Leahy referred to the questionnaire, which asked if Sessions had been in contact with anyone connected to the Russian government.",
      "Sessions defended the travel ban in his opening statements on Wednesday, saying it was an \"important step\" for national security.",
      "And if this isn't legitimate and you make the specific cases, we'll review it, but it shouldn't be done casually, I got to say.\"",
      "Later in the questioning, Sessions added: \"My staff handed me a note that I have not been asked for an interview at this point.",
      "Sessions told the committee: \"I cannot waive that privilege myself or otherwise compromise his ability to assert it.\"",
      "It was later revealed that Sessions met with then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak on multiple occasions.",
      "\"I dumped a Dr. Pepper on Sen. Cruz, so that was what was distracting us on this side of the dais,\" Sasse cracked.",
      "Franken read extensively from Sessions' public statements, saying repeatedly \"the goalposts have been moved.\"",
      "\"This period of abeyance has turned into a non-assertion assertion of executive privilege,\" Whitehouse said.",
      "He later told Blumenthal: \"My understanding is a pardon can be issued before a conviction's occurred.\"",
      "\"Every one of your previous questions talked about improper involvement and I felt the answer was no.\"",
      "Sessions denied the allegation and expressed dismay that his former committee chairman would make it.",
      "\"It did hurt me to hear you say I'm part of a façade, I'm not part of a façade,\" Sessions said.",
      "\"Well the pardon power is quite broad,\" Sessions said, saying he'd prefer to answer in writing.",
      "He said they had asked the FBI to give the full committee a briefing on it but were denied.",
      "Leahy asked Sessions about his response to a question on his confirmation questionnaire.",
      "This story has been updated with additional developments and will continue to update.",
      "The presidential pardon power also came up in relation to the Russia investigation.",
      "\"You have now gone through this long talk that I believe is totally unfair to me.\"",
      "\"It is a lawful and necessary order that we are proud to defend,\" Sessions said.",
      "\"We're confident that we will prevail as time goes by in the Supreme Court.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry, I've known you for years, and I'm sorry you would do that. \"",
      "\"I think it was a good faith response to a dramatic event at the time.",
      "\"Mr. Chairman, I don't have to sit here and listen --\" Sessions said.",
      "\"Without having a chance to respond, give me a break,\" Sessions said.",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Sessions said, adding he was \"not aware of it.\"",
      "I don't know whether that would be appropriate or not, frankly.\"",
      "\"You seem to know, I don't want to come in here and be trapped.",
      "And I don't think it's fair for you to suggest otherwise.\"",
      "\"This is not a little matter, is all I'm saying to you.",
      "Incredulous, Blumenthal asked Sessions if he was sure.",
      "... By the end, we're going to a 75-yard field goal.\"",
      "\"You're the one who's testifying,\" Franken shot back.",
      "'That, to me, is moving the goal posts every time.",
      "Sessions said he would follow up \"within hours.\"",
      "\"The answer's no,\" Sessions finally said.",
      "... Maybe you better check your source.\"",
      "\"The ambassador from Russia is Russian.",
      "\"I'm disappointed,\" Sessions said.",

      "First, belief in this narrative at face value requires one to blatantly disregard a series of fundamental questions:\n\nQuestion 1: If George Papadopoulos was central to the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign, why did the FBI wait more than 6 months to interview him in late January and again in February?",
      "Last week, the New York Times published an article using four current and former anonymous intelligence officials to suggest that George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign volunteer, was a “driving factor” who triggered the FBI’s spying on the Trump campaign.",

      "Question 2: If Papadopoulos was so critical to the investigation, why did the FBI get a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, warrant on Carter Page in the summer of 2016 but not on Papadopoulos, the alleged central player?",
      "These anonymous sources claim that Papadopoulos, during a night of drinking at a bar in Europe, tipped off Australian diplomats about Russian collusion efforts, which ultimately led to the FBI opening an investigation.",

      "It’s apparent that Comey has never had a problem sharing information with reporters, and he allowed his team to \"follow the leader\" in that regard—but it is time for this practice to come to an immediate end.",
      "Yet, in spite of the constant headlines, rampant speculation, and overshadowing of accomplishments, a simple truth remains: There is no evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.",

      "Even with the complete dearth of evidence Congressional hearings have produced, the narrative machine continues to mobilize.",
      "How many FBI agents and DOJ officials have illegally discussed aspects of an ongoing investigation with reporters?",
      "Why do they continue to refuse transparency on whether they paid Christopher Steele for the Russian Dossier?",
      "Perhaps all of these questions have answers that could help bring this Russian collusion drama to a close.",

      "As both sides discussed the witness-tampering allegation, Westling urged the judge to consider options short of jail that could be added to the existing terms of his release “that can prevent this from occurring in the future.” He said a no-contact order with others in the case could achieve that result and said the current release terms had not explicitly included that restriction.",
      "[Manafort accused in new charges of secretly funding European officials]\n\nManafort has repeatedly declared his intention to fight the charges in both jurisdictions, with his attorneys saying that he is being wrongly prosecuted for financial activities that have nothing to do with Russian interference in the 2016 election, the main focus of Mueller’s investigation.",
      "Asked whether he might consider pardoning former aides and advisers, Trump answered, “I don’t want to talk about that.”\n\nBut Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Trump attorney, told the New York Daily News on Friday that the Mueller investigation “might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons.”\n\nGiuliani later backtracked from his suggestion pardons might be coming.",
      "His attorney Richard Westling had urged the judge not to send him to jail, saying that it was not required by law and that doing so “will create more challenges for the defense, which already faces trial in two courts.”\n\nThe order to incarcerate Manafort capped a months-long fight over the terms of his bail.",
      "“The government motion will be granted, and the defendant will be detained.”\n\nThe judge said sending Manafort to a cell was “an extraordinarily difficult decision” but said his conduct — allegedly contacting witnesses in the case in an effort to get them to lie to investigators — left her little choice.",
      "“Wow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns,” Trump tweeted Friday afternoon, just before turning his attention to former FBI director James B. Comey and Hillary Clinton.",
      "A federal judge ordered Paul Manafort to jail Friday over charges he tampered with witnesses while out on bail — a major blow for President Trump’s former campaign chairman as he awaits trial on federal conspiracy and money-laundering charges next month.",
      "On June 8, he and a Russian business associate were charged with obstruction of justice after prosecutors say they tried to persuade two potential witnesses to tell investigators the Ukraine lobbying effort did not include activity in the United States.",
      "Andres replied that “it’s inconceivable that [Manafort] doesn’t know that they’re potential witnesses.”\n\nThe fall indictment of Manafort and his longtime deputy, Rick Gates, marked the first public charges in the special-counsel investigation.",
      "Most of the criminal counts relate to activity that preceded Manafort’s time as Trump’s campaign manager from March to August of 2016, when he resigned amid news reports that he had received secret cash payments for his Ukraine consulting.",
      "They went back 12 years to get things that he did 12 years ago.”\n\nTrump added that Manafort “worked for me for a very short period of time.” In 2016, Manafort served as Trump’s campaign chairman during the Republican National Convention.",
      "[Mueller accuses Paul Manafort of witness tampering]\n\nManafort’s attorneys have denied the tampering allegations and accused prosecutors of conjuring charges to pressure him to flip his plea and turn against Trump and his associates.",

      "He had been confined to his home on electronic monitoring and other restrictions since he was first indicted Oct. 27 during special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.",
      "Very unfair!”\n\nHours earlier, Trump had defended Manafort in remarks to reporters outside the White House, saying his former campaign chairman “has nothing to do with our campaign, but I tell you I feel a little badly about it.",
      "There should be no pardons.”\n\nProsecutors alleged that by committing a new crime while on release, Manafort violated the terms of his home confinement in Alexandria, Va., and they asked the judge to revoke or revise it.",
      "Prosecutors have said that Manafort’s role in the campaign and long-standing ties to Russian-backed politicians, financiers and others merited investigation into whether any of them served as back channels to Russia.",
      "In addition to the texts and phone calls cited in the government’s earlier filing, Andres said one of the witnesses had provided an affidavit through his lawyer about one call from Manafort that was completed.",
      "In December, they accused him of violating a court’s gag order by helping ghostwrite an op-ed piece defending his work in Ukraine for an English-language newspaper in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.",
      "By just before 8:30 p.m. Friday, jail records indicate, he had been processed into the Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Va., prisoner number 45343, about 90 miles southeast of Washington.",
      "“If I tell him not to call 56 witnesses, will he call the 57th?” She said she should not have to draft a court order spelling out the entire criminal code for him to avoid violations.",
      "The obstruction charges flow out of lobbying work in 2012 on behalf of Ukraine’s pro-Russian president at the time, Viktor Yanukovych, and his Party of Regions.",
      "Andres summarized what he called “a sustained campaign over a five-week period” by Manafort to reach the two witnesses and influence their testimony.",
      "He also faces a federal trial in Virginia in July for related tax- and bank-fraud charges brought as prosecutors reviewed his financial dealings.",
      "Manafort was arraigned Friday on the obstruction counts and is set for trial in Washington in September over the allegations of secret lobbying.",
      "“I’m concerned you seem to treat these proceedings as another marketing exercise.”\n\nManafort was led out of the courtroom by security officers.",
      "Gates, 46, pleaded guilty in February to lying to investigators and agreed to provide information in a cooperation deal with Mueller’s team.",
      "In asking for Manafort to be jailed, prosecutor Greg Andres said in court that there was a danger Manafort would continue to commit crimes.",
      "Jackson, the judge, declined to punish Manafort then but warned she would probably consider similar actions in the future as a violation.",
      "The jailing order marked the latest fall for the political power broker and confidant of Republican presidents dating to Ronald Reagan.",
      "A Manafort associate, Konstantin Kilimnik, also was charged with obstruction in connection with the alleged approaches to witnesses.",
      "That’s when we started investigating,” Andres said, adding: “There is no way to monitor Mr. Manafort’s communications.",
      "Kilimnik is believed to be in Moscow — and therefore safe from arrest because Russia does not extradite its citizens.",
      "“You have abused the trust placed in you six months ago,” U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson told Manafort.",
      "The case against him includes failing to register in the United States as a lobbyist for a foreign government.",
      "“We learned about it because a witness in this case brought forward information about the tampering.",
      "Prosecutors had previously complained to the judge about Manafort’s behavior as he awaited trial.",
      "Manafort had been asking to post a $10 million bond and end the seven months of home detention.",
      "Prosecutors have previously said Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, which he denies.",
      "He turned and gave a last look and wave to his wife, seated in the well of the court.",

      "“Our advice is not to do it,” he told The Washington Post.",
      "At the least, he has shown he is adept” at making them.",
      "It is about the defendant’s conduct,” Jackson said.",
      "“Didn’t know Manafort was the head of the Mob.",
      "I can’t take away his cellphone,” she said.",
      "“It would have to be way down the road.",
