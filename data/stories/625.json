  "LISA DESJARDINS:\n\nWell, Judy, this was an extraordinary hearing.",
  "I counted 259 questions in just over two-and-a-half-hours to Mr. Comey, and after all of that, in the end, Judy, I have to say, overall, I came away with a feeling from senators that they are moving in a more bipartisan direction than they were a couple weeks ago.",
  "There were very few senators who were willing to take sides on this debate between Mr. Comey and President Trump and his attorney, not willing to say yet who they believe in that fight.",
  "Mostly, they're deferring to Mr. Mueller and the upcoming â€” his special investigation.",
  "There were a few partisan hits.",
  "Chuck Schumer, Democratic leader in the Senate, took to the floor and said the clouds over the White House have become darker.",
  "On the other hand, we have Roy Blunt of Missouri, Republican, who said he felt that today the president did better than worse.",
  "And another sign of that, Judy, talking to Ron Wyden, Democrat, who is one of the president's sharpest critics, when asked about the idea of obstruction of justice and what he thought came from this hearing today on that front, he said, to him, obstruction of justice is a lawyer's term.",
  "He thought there was instead a pattern of abuse of power.",
  "What that told me, Judy, was that they didn't feel that they made any ground on that case for obstruction of justice."
